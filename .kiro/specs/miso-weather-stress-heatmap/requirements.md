# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The MISO Weather-Stress Heatmap MVP is a comprehensive data science tool that ingests short-term weather forecasts and current energy infrastructure/flow proxies within the MISO (Midcontinent Independent System Operator) footprint. The system computes grid-stress risk scores and outputs interactive heat maps for multiple forecast horizons (+12h, +24h, +36h, +48h). The tool aims to provide transparent, reproducible, and explainable risk assessment for grid operators and analysts while remaining fuel-agnostic and policy-neutral.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a grid operator, I want to visualize weather-related stress risks across the MISO footprint at multiple forecast horizons, so that I can proactively identify potential grid vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL generate interactive heat maps for 12h, 24h, 36h, and 48h forecast horizons
2. WHEN displaying risk data THEN the system SHALL use a consistent geographic grid (hex bins ~25-50 km) clipped to the MISO footprint
3. WHEN a user interacts with the map THEN each grid cell SHALL display risk score, top 3 contributing factors, confidence level, and key weather inputs in tooltips
4. WHEN exporting results THEN the system SHALL save HTML maps, PNG snapshots, and CSV data files

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want the system to ingest weather forecast data from reliable sources, so that risk calculations are based on accurate meteorological information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fetching weather data THEN the system SHALL primarily use NOAA/NWS gridpoint forecast API
2. IF NOAA/NWS is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to Open-Meteo forecast API
3. WHEN processing weather data THEN the system SHALL extract temperature, heat index, wind speed, wind gust, precipitation rate, snow rate, dewpoint, relative humidity, and storm probability
4. WHEN aggregating forecast data THEN the system SHALL compute mean/max values per grid cell from native forecast resolution
5. WHEN caching data THEN the system SHALL store raw pulls in data/raw/ and processed data in data/processed/

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an analyst, I want the system to incorporate infrastructure and load exposure data, so that risk scores reflect actual grid vulnerabilities and population exposure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating exposure THEN the system SHALL use population density from Census data as a primary factor
2. WHEN assessing vulnerability THEN the system SHALL incorporate generation capacity mix (wind/solar/thermal percentages) within 50km of each cell
3. WHEN available THEN the system SHALL include transmission line density as a vulnerability factor
4. WHEN processing capacity data THEN the system SHALL use EIA-860/923 data or equivalent public capacity information
5. IF transmission data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL use a baseline transmission scarcity value of 0.5 and document this limitation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a grid operator, I want transparent and explainable risk scoring methodology, so that I can understand and trust the risk assessments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN computing thermal stress THEN the system SHALL use defined thresholds: heat stress (0 at HI≤85°F, 1 at HI≥100°F), cold stress (0 at T≥10°F, 1 at T≤0°F)
2. WHEN computing wind stress THEN the system SHALL score: 0 at gust≤20 mph, 1 at gust≥50 mph, with bonus for sustained wind≥30 mph
3. WHEN computing precipitation stress THEN the system SHALL score: 0 at no precip, 1 at heavy rates (rain ≥10 mm/h, snow ≥5 cm/h, any ice accretion)
4. WHEN calculating final risk THEN the system SHALL use the formula: Risk = zscore(α*Hazard + β*Exposure + γ*Vulnerability)
5. WHEN displaying methodology THEN the system SHALL document all thresholds, weights, and formulas in markdown tables within the notebook

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configurable operation modes and reproducible results, so that the system can run in different environments with consistent outputs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the system THEN it SHALL support RUN_MODE = "demo" (cached/sample data) or "live" (API calls)
2. WHEN running in any mode THEN the system SHALL use a fixed random seed for reproducibility
3. WHEN processing data THEN the system SHALL use EPSG:4326 coordinate reference system consistently
4. WHEN configuring weights THEN the system SHALL allow user modification via YAML configuration block
5. WHEN completing analysis THEN the system SHALL export a method card documenting data sources, scoring methodology, and caveats

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a quality assurance analyst, I want built-in validation and confidence metrics, so that I can assess the reliability of risk predictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN computing risk scores THEN the system SHALL calculate confidence based on data coverage and forecast horizon
2. WHEN data coverage is insufficient THEN the system SHALL warn users and degrade to demo mode if coverage < threshold
3. WHEN validating results THEN the system SHALL perform ablation analysis showing risk changes when components are dropped
4. WHEN logging operations THEN the system SHALL record all configuration parameters and data source URLs used
5. WHEN forecast horizon increases THEN confidence SHALL decrease appropriately

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a future developer, I want extensible architecture and clear documentation, so that additional risk factors can be integrated easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing the system THEN it SHALL include stub functions for additional stressors (resource transition, load growth indicators)
2. WHEN extending functionality THEN new components SHALL maintain the same risk scoring interface
3. WHEN documenting the system THEN it SHALL include clear instructions for adding new data sources and risk factors
4. WHEN structuring code THEN it SHALL separate data adapters, feature engineering, scoring, and visualization into distinct, reusable functions
5. WHEN creating outputs THEN the system SHALL generate standardized file formats (HTML, PNG, CSV, MD) for consistent integration

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an operations center analyst, I want actionable summary outputs, so that I can quickly identify priority areas and understand key risk drivers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL generate "Ops Notes" listing top hotspots, primary risk drivers, and confidence assessments
2. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL show top-10 highest risk cells per horizon with contributing factors
3. WHEN presenting data THEN the system SHALL use clear color scales (sequential YlOrRd) with legends and captions
4. WHEN exporting summaries THEN the system SHALL include data freshness timestamps and API source links
5. WHEN identifying limitations THEN the system SHALL clearly document assumptions, proxy usage, and data gaps
