===============================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
===============================================================================

This report provides weather-related grid stress risk assessment for the MISO
footprint across multiple forecast horizons. Risk scores are relative measures
designed to highlight areas of elevated concern for grid operations.

IMPORTANT: This analysis uses proxy data and simplified models. Results are for
research purposes only and should not be used for operational decisions without
validation by qualified grid operators.

DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS
===============================================================================

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS:

1. RESEARCH TOOL ONLY: This system is designed for research and analysis 
   purposes. Results should NOT be used for operational decisions without 
   validation by qualified grid operators.

2. PROXY DATA USAGE: The analysis relies on proxy data including:
   - Population density as proxy for electrical load
   - Generation capacity as proxy for actual output
   - Simplified transmission density calculations

3. MODEL LIMITATIONS:
   - Linear risk scoring functions may not capture complex interactions
   - Static infrastructure data does not reflect real-time conditions
   - Weather forecast uncertainty is not explicitly modeled

4. SPATIAL LIMITATIONS:
   - Approximately 40-km grid resolution may mask local variations
   - Edge effects at MISO boundary
   - Point-to-grid aggregation introduces uncertainty

5. TEMPORAL LIMITATIONS:
   - Forecast accuracy decreases with longer horizons
   - No consideration of diurnal load patterns
   - Static seasonal adjustments

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:

- Use results for situational awareness and trend identification
- Validate high-risk areas with additional data sources
- Consider local knowledge and operational experience
- Monitor forecast updates and confidence levels
- Treat as one input among many for decision making

For technical questions or methodology details, refer to the accompanying 
method card and documentation.
