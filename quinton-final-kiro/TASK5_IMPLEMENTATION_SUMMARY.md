# Task 5 Implementation Summary: Feature Engineering and Normalization System

## Overview
Successfully implemented the complete feature engineering and normalization system for the MISO Weather-Stress Heatmap. This system transforms raw weather data into normalized risk factors according to the transparent scoring methodology defined in the requirements.

## Implementation Details

### 5.1 Thermal Stress Calculation Functions ✅
**File**: `feature_engineering.py` - `calculate_thermal_stress()`

**Implementation**:
- **Heat stress scoring**: 0 at HI≤85°F, 1 at HI≥100°F, linear interpolation
- **Cold stress scoring**: 0 at T≥10°F, 1 at T≤0°F, linear interpolation  
- **Combined thermal stress**: max(heat_score, cold_score)
- **Input handling**: Supports scalars, numpy arrays, and pandas Series
- **Edge case handling**: Proper capping and boundary condition management

**Key Features**:
- Uses heat index for heat stress calculation (more accurate than temperature alone)
- Uses actual temperature for cold stress calculation
- Linear interpolation between thresholds for smooth scoring
- Validates threshold behavior at exact boundaries

### 5.2 Wind Stress Calculation Functions ✅
**File**: `feature_engineering.py` - `calculate_wind_stress()`

**Implementation**:
- **Wind gust scoring**: 0 at ≤20mph, 1 at ≥50mph, linear interpolation
- **Sustained wind bonus**: +0.2 if sustained wind ≥30mph
- **Maximum capping**: Total wind stress capped at 1.0
- **Validation logic**: Tests various wind speed combinations

**Key Features**:
- Base stress calculated from wind gusts (primary wind hazard)
- Additional bonus for sustained high winds (infrastructure stress factor)
- Proper capping prevents scores > 1.0
- Handles both instantaneous and sustained wind measurements

### 5.3 Precipitation Stress Calculation Functions ✅
**File**: `feature_engineering.py` - `calculate_precipitation_stress()`

**Implementation**:
- **Rain rate scoring**: 0 at 0mm/h, 1 at ≥10mm/h, linear interpolation
- **Snow rate scoring**: 0 at 0cm/h, 1 at ≥5cm/h, linear interpolation
- **Ice accretion**: Immediate maximum score (1.0) for any ice
- **Combined scoring**: max(rain_stress, snow_stress, ice_stress)

**Key Features**:
- Different thresholds for different precipitation types
- Ice treated as immediate maximum hazard (realistic for grid infrastructure)
- Maximum selection ensures dominant precipitation type drives score
- Handles mixed precipitation scenarios correctly

### 5.4 Storm Proxy Calculation ✅
**File**: `feature_engineering.py` - `calculate_storm_proxy()`

**Implementation**:
- **Full storm conditions**: precipitation > 0 AND wind gust ≥35mph = 1.0
- **Scaled scoring**: precipitation × wind gust product for partial conditions
- **Storm detection logic**: Validates against extreme weather scenarios
- **Threshold behavior**: Tests storm proxy accuracy

**Key Features**:
- Combines precipitation and wind for compound hazard assessment
- Binary storm detection for severe conditions
- Graduated scoring for developing storm conditions
- Realistic storm wind threshold (35mph) for grid impact

## Technical Architecture

### Key Methods

### Input/Output Handling

# Process weather data
weather_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'temp_2m': [70.0, 95.0, -5.0],
    'heat_index': [75.0, 110.0, 60.0],

    'precip_rate': [0.0, 0.0, 8.0],
    'snow_rate': [0.0, 0.0, 0.0],

# Validate scores
validation = engine.validate_stress_scores(result)
```
