2021-09-29,Introduced in Senate,Senate,Senate,Department of Energy and Nuclear Regulatory Commission Whistleblower Protection Act,"<p><strong>Department of Energy and Nuclear Regulatory Commission Whistleblower Protection Act</strong></p><p>This bill clarifies that the scope of whistleblower protections under the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 covers civil servants filing complaints against their employers, such as the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), if the employers discharge or otherwise discriminate against civil servants who engage in certain protected activities, including (1) reporting alleged nuclear safety violations to the employer, (2) refusing to engage in certain unlawful practices, or (3) testifying at or participating in certain governmental proceedings.</p><p>In 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in <em>Peck v. Department of Labor </em>dismissed a complaint by a civil servant against the NRC for discriminating against the civil servant for whistleblowing activities on the grounds that the act does not waive sovereign immunity (i.e., the federal government's immunity from the jurisdiction of U.S. courts). Specifically, the court held that (1) the whistleblower protections in the&nbsp;act authorize complaints against persons (e.g., corporate employers) that discriminate against their employees, and (2) federal employers like DOE and the NRC are not considered to be persons.</p><p>The bill modifies the act to waive sovereign immunity by clarifying that the whistleblower protections apply to employees of any <em>employer—</em>not just a <em>person</em><em>—</em>that discharges or otherwise discriminates against its employee for being a whistleblower&nbsp;of nuclear safety violations. Thus, the bill includes civil servants under the act's whistleblower protections on nuclear safety violations.&nbsp;</p><!--tinycomments|2.1|data:application/json;base64,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-->",117,117-S2896,S,2896,https://api.congress.gov/v3/bill/117/s/2896?format=json,2024-10-07 20:56:33+00:00,2024-10-07T20:55:52Z

It also addresses other related issues, such as modifying the formulas for calculating such user fees and reauthorizing various programs. (The FDA collects user fees from various entities, including companies that produce drugs and medical devices. The total amounts generated by each user fee program are set out in statutes. Generally, the FDA negotiates these user fees with the relevant industry every five years.)</p> <p>TITLE I--FEES RELATING TO DRUGS</p> <p><em>Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022</em></p> <p>(Sec. 1002) This section modifies various definitions in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Specifically, it modifies the definition of <em>human drug application</em> to include applications for certain allergenic extract products licensed on or after October 1, 2022.</p> <p>For the purposes of assessing the prescription drug program fee, if a drug manufacturer makes a request for a particular prescription drug to be placed on the list for discontinued drugs, the FDA shall consider the drug discontinued on the date the request is received or when the product will be withdrawn from sale, whichever is later.</p> <p>This section also establishes a statutory definition for <em>skin-test diagnostic product</em>. Generally, such a product is administered to the skin to detect a local hypersensitivity reaction to aid the diagnosis of an allergy or infection with certain pathogens.</p> <p>(Sec. 1003) This section modifies the method by which the FDA assesses drug user fees and extends through FY2027 the FDA's authority to assess and collect such fees. For example, this section establishes through FY2027 the annual base revenue and various adjustments. (The base revenue and various adjustments set the total amount of user fees that the FDA must collect through the particular user fee program each fiscal year.)</p> <p>For the purposes of setting drug user fees, the FDA must make various adjustments including (1) increasing the fees collected each fiscal year for strategic hiring and retention purposes, and (2) adjusting the fees collected for each fiscal year by employing the capacity planning method the FDA used to set such fees for FY2021.</p> <p>This section also establishes that a human drug application for a skin-test diagnostic product shall not be subject to certain fees.</p> <p>Furthermore, this section establishes a rule for fees for an approved human prescription drug that was on the discontinued list on the first day of a fiscal year but is no longer on the list later in the same fiscal year. Generally, the relevant manufacturers of such a drug must pay the annual prescription drug program fee for that fiscal year, if the manufacturer has had a human drug application or supplement pending before the FDA after September 1, 1992.</p> <p>This section also modifies exemptions to the prescription drug program fees for certain drugs. Specifically, this section exempts from such fees (1) certain large volume parenteral products, (2) drugs that are pharmaceutically equivalent to certain FDA-approved drugs, and (3) skin-test diagnostic products.</p> <p>(Sec. 1005) This section repeals a provision that terminates (1) on October 1, 2022, the FDA's authority to assess and collect user fees relating to human drugs, and (2) reporting requirements related to such authority.</p> <p>TITLE II--FEES RELATING TO DEVICES</p> <p><em>Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2022</em></p> <p>(Sec. 2002) This section amends the statutory definition of <em>process for the review of device applications </em>to include activities related to de novo classification requests. (Medical devices are assigned to one of three classes based on the level of control necessary to assure the device's safety and effectiveness.)</p> <p>(Sec. 2003) This section modifies the method by which the FDA assesses medical device user fees and extends through FY2027 the FDA's authority to assess and collect such fees. For example, the section establishes the total revenue amounts to be generated from such fees for each fiscal year through FY2027.</p> <p>For the purpose of calculating such user fees, this section also authorizes increases for various purposes. For example, for FY2025-FY2027, the base establishment registration fee amounts shall be increased by specified amounts to meet improved performance goals for reviewing certain medical device applications. Other adjustments required by this section include decreases in the amount to be collected for such user fees if (1) the FDA's hiring to support the medical device application process is below certain thresholds, or (2) operating reserves for medical device application review operations exceed certain thresholds.</p> <p>(Sec. 2005) This section permanently reauthorizes and modifies a program under which accredited testing laboratories are involved in assessing whether a medical device complies with certain statutory requirements. Currently, such a laboratory shall assess whether a device conforms to the relevant requirements. Under this section, a laboratory shall conduct tests to support such assessments.</p> <p>(Sec. 2006) This section reauthorizes through December 17, 2022, a program that allows accredited persons to review reports and make recommendations to the FDA pertaining to the initial classification of medical devices.</p> <p>(Sec. 2007) This section repeals a provision that terminates (1) on October 1, 2022, the FDA's authority to assess and collect user fees relating to medical devices, and (2) reporting requirements related to such authority.</p> <p>TITLE III--FEES RELATING TO GENERIC DRUGS<br> <em><br> Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022</em></p> <p>(Sec. 3002) This section modifies the method by which the FDA assesses generic drug user fees and extends through FY2027 the FDA's authority to assess and collect such fees. For example, this section establishes through FY2027 the annual base revenue amount and various adjustments to set the total amount that the FDA must collect each fiscal year for the particular user fee program.</p> <p>The FDA must establish a capacity planning methodology to meet the resource capacity needed for the FDA's human generic drug activities and increase the revenue collected under this user fee program accordingly.</p> <p>The FDA may also increase the user fees assessed for a fiscal year to meet certain operating reserve thresholds for the FDA's human generic drug activities. If the operating reserve increases above certain thresholds, the FDA must reduce the user fees accordingly.</p> <p>(Sec. 3004) This section repeals a provision that terminates (1) on October 1, 2022, the FDA's authority to assess and collect user fees relating to human generic drugs, and (2) reporting requirements related to such authority.</p> <p>TITLE IV--FEES RELATING TO BIOSIMILAR BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS</p> <p><em>Biosimilar User Fee Amendments of 2022</em></p> <p>(Sec. 4002) This section amends the definition of <em>biosimilar biological product application </em>to include a qualifying application for an allergenic extract product. Currently, applications for allergenic extract products are specifically excluded from the definition.</p> <p>(Sec. 4003) This section modifies the method by which the FDA assesses biosimilar biological product user fees and extends through FY2027 the FDA's authority to assess and collect such fees. For example, this section establishes through FY2027 the annual base revenue and various adjustments to set the total amount that the FDA must collect each fiscal year through the user fee program.</p> <p>For the purposes of setting such user fees, the FDA must (1) increase the fees collected each fiscal year for strategic hiring and retention purposes, and (2) adjust the fees collected for each fiscal year by employing the capacity planning method the FDA used to set such fees in FY2021.</p> <p>The FDA must also increase the user fees assessed for a fiscal year if doing so is necessary to meet certain operating reserve thresholds for the FDA's review of biosimilar biological product applications. If the operating reserve increases above certain thresholds, the FDA must reduce the user fees accordingly.</p> <p>The section also makes other changes to the biosimilar user fees, including by (1) authorizing the FDA to administratively remove from the biosimilar biological product development program a person who has failed to pay the required fee for two consecutive years, and (2) eliminating the biosimilar biological product fee.</p> <p>Furthermore, for the purposes of assessing the biosimilar biological product program fee, if a biosimilar product manufacturer makes a request for a particular biosimilar product to be placed on a list for discontinued products, the FDA shall consider the product discontinued on the date the request is received or when the product will be withdrawn from sale, whichever is later.</p> <p>If an approved biosimilar product was on the discontinued list on the first day of a fiscal year but is no longer on the list later in the fiscal year, the manufacturer of the product must pay the annual biosimilar biological product program fee for that fiscal year.</p> <p>(Sec. 4005) This section repeals a provision that terminates (1) on October 1, 2022, the FDA's authority to assess and collect user fees relating to biosimilar biological products, and (2) reporting requirements related to such authority.</p> <p>TITLE V--REAUTHORIZATION OF OTHER PROVISIONS</p> <p>(Sec. 5001) This section reauthorizes a National Institutes of Health program to (1) develop and publish a priority list of needs in pediatric therapeutics, and (2) award funds to entities with expertise in conducting research regarding such needs.</p> <p>(Sec. 5002) This section reauthorizes through December 17, 2022, the humanitarian device exemption program, which authorizes the FDA to, for the purposes of an application for approval to market a medical device, waive certain effectiveness requirements for an eligible device designed to treat or diagnose a disease or condition that affects no more than 8,000 individuals in the United States. Specifically, a request for such an exemption must be submitted on or before December 17, 2022.</p> <p>(Sec. 5003) This section reauthorizes a program that provides grants or contracts to nonprofit consortia for demonstration projects to promote pediatric device development.</p> <p>(Sec. 5004) This section reauthorizes a provision that allows an applicant for market approval for an eligible single-enantiomer drug to make an election that may qualify the drug for a five-year market exclusivity period.</p> <p>(Sec. 5005) This section reauthorizes the Critical Path Public-Private Partnerships, through which the FDA may enter into collaborative agreements with eligible entities to develop projects designed to achieve certain goals, such as fostering medical product innovation and accelerating medical product development.</p> <p>(Sec. 5006) This section reauthorizes an FDA program that provides grants to defray the costs of developing drugs, medical devices, and medical foods for rare diseases or conditions.</p> <p>(Sec. 5007) This section extends through December 17, 2022, a provision requiring the FDA to accredit persons to inspect facilities that manufacture certain classes of medical devices.</p> <p>(Sec. 5008) This section reauthorizes a provision requiring the FDA to post on its website quarterly reports with information on received generic drug applications and priority review applications.</p> <p>DIVISION G--HERMIT'S PEAK/CALF CANYON FIRE ASSISTANCE ACT</p> <p><em>Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire Assistance Act</em></p> <p>This division provides for monetary compensation to the persons injured by the prescribed fire burn in the Santa Fe National Forest in New Mexico that became a wildfire known as the Hermit's Peak Fire or the Hermit's Peak Fire/Calf Canyon Fire.</p> <p>Each person injured as a result the Hermit's Peak Fire shall be eligible to receive monetary compensation from the United States, including for personal injury, loss of property, business loss, or financial loss.</p> <p>An Office of Hermit's Peak Fire Claims is established within the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to receive, process, and pay claims from persons injured by the fire.</p> <p>FEMA or the independent claims manager (which FEMA may appoint) shall, on behalf of the United States, investigate, consider, ascertain, adjust, determine, grant, deny, or settle any claim for money damages asserted by a person injured by the Hermit's Peak Fire.</p> <p>Any claimant aggrieved by a final decision of FEMA concerning compensation may, not later than 60 days after the date on which the decision is issued, bring a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico to modify or set aside the decision.</p>",117,117-HR6833,HR,6833,https://api.congress.gov/v3/bill/117/hr/6833?format=json,2022-10-22 23:32:34+00:00,2022-10-21T22:20:54Z

Generally, the FDA negotiates these user fees with the relevant industry every five years.)</p> <p>TITLE I--FEES RELATING TO DRUGS</p> <p><em>Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022</em></p> <p>(Sec. 1002) This section modifies various definitions in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

For example, this section establishes through FY2027 the annual base revenue and various adjustments. (The base revenue and various adjustments set the total amount of user fees that the FDA must collect through the particular user fee program each fiscal year.)</p> <p>For the purposes of setting drug user fees, the FDA must make various adjustments including (1) increasing the fees collected each fiscal year for strategic hiring and retention purposes, and (2) adjusting the fees collected for each fiscal year by employing the capacity planning method the FDA used to set such fees for FY2021.</p> <p>This section also establishes that a human drug application for a skin-test diagnostic product shall not be subject to certain fees.</p> <p>Furthermore, this section establishes a rule for fees for an approved human prescription drug that was on the discontinued list on the first day of a fiscal year but is no longer on the list later in the same fiscal year. Generally, the relevant manufacturers of such a drug must pay the annual prescription drug program fee for that fiscal year, if the manufacturer has had a human drug application or supplement pending before the FDA after September 1, 1992.</p> <p>This section also modifies exemptions to the prescription drug program fees for certain drugs.

For example, the section establishes the total revenue amounts to be generated from such fees for each fiscal year through FY2027.</p> <p>For the purpose of calculating such user fees, this section also authorizes increases for various purposes. For example, for FY2025-FY2027, the base establishment registration fee amounts shall be increased by specified amounts to meet improved performance goals for reviewing certain medical device applications. Other adjustments required by this section include decreases in the amount to be collected for such user fees if (1) the FDA's hiring to support the medical device application process is below certain thresholds, or (2) operating reserves for medical device application review operations exceed certain thresholds.</p> <p>(Sec. 2005) This section permanently reauthorizes and modifies a program under which accredited testing laboratories are involved in assessing whether a medical device complies with certain statutory requirements. Currently, such a laboratory shall assess whether a device conforms to the relevant requirements. Under this section, a laboratory shall conduct tests to support such assessments.</p> <p>(Sec. 2006) This section reauthorizes through December 17, 2022, a program that allows accredited persons to review reports and make recommendations to the FDA pertaining to the initial classification of medical devices.</p> <p>(Sec. 2007) This section repeals a provision that terminates (1) on October 1, 2022, the FDA's authority to assess and collect user fees relating to medical devices, and (2) reporting requirements related to such authority.</p> <p>TITLE III--FEES RELATING TO GENERIC DRUGS<br> <em><br> Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022</em></p> <p>(Sec. 3002) This section modifies the method by which the FDA assesses generic drug user fees and extends through FY2027 the FDA's authority to assess and collect such fees. For example, this section establishes through FY2027 the annual base revenue amount and various adjustments to set the total amount that the FDA must collect each fiscal year for the particular user fee program.</p> <p>The FDA must establish a capacity planning methodology to meet the resource capacity needed for the FDA's human generic drug activities and increase the revenue collected under this user fee program accordingly.</p> <p>The FDA may also increase the user fees assessed for a fiscal year to meet certain operating reserve thresholds for the FDA's human generic drug activities. If the operating reserve increases above certain thresholds, the FDA must reduce the user fees accordingly.</p> <p>(Sec. 3004) This section repeals a provision that terminates (1) on October 1, 2022, the FDA's authority to assess and collect user fees relating to human generic drugs, and (2) reporting requirements related to such authority.</p> <p>TITLE IV--FEES RELATING TO BIOSIMILAR BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS</p> <p><em>Biosimilar User Fee Amendments of 2022</em></p> <p>(Sec. 4002) This section amends the definition of <em>biosimilar biological product application </em>to include a qualifying application for an allergenic extract product. Currently, applications for allergenic extract products are specifically excluded from the definition.</p> <p>(Sec. 4003) This section modifies the method by which the FDA assesses biosimilar biological product user fees and extends through FY2027 the FDA's authority to assess and collect such fees. For example, this section establishes through FY2027 the annual base revenue and various adjustments to set the total amount that the FDA must collect each fiscal year through the user fee program.</p> <p>For the purposes of setting such user fees, the FDA must (1) increase the fees collected each fiscal year for strategic hiring and retention purposes, and (2) adjust the fees collected for each fiscal year by employing the capacity planning method the FDA used to set such fees in FY2021.</p> <p>The FDA must also increase the user fees assessed for a fiscal year if doing so is necessary to meet certain operating reserve thresholds for the FDA's review of biosimilar biological product applications. If the operating reserve increases above certain thresholds, the FDA must reduce the user fees accordingly.</p> <p>The section also makes other changes to the biosimilar user fees, including by (1) authorizing the FDA to administratively remove from the biosimilar biological product development program a person who has failed to pay the required fee for two consecutive years, and (2) eliminating the biosimilar biological product fee.</p> <p>Furthermore, for the purposes of assessing the biosimilar biological product program fee, if a biosimilar product manufacturer makes a request for a particular biosimilar product to be placed on a list for discontinued products, the FDA shall consider the product discontinued on the date the request is received or when the product will be withdrawn from sale, whichever is later.</p> <p>If an approved biosimilar product was on the discontinued list on the first day of a fiscal year but is no longer on the list later in the fiscal year, the manufacturer of the product must pay the annual biosimilar biological product program fee for that fiscal year.</p> <p>(Sec. 4005) This section repeals a provision that terminates (1) on October 1, 2022, the FDA's authority to assess and collect user fees relating to biosimilar biological products, and (2) reporting requirements related to such authority.</p> <p>TITLE V--REAUTHORIZATION OF OTHER PROVISIONS</p> <p>(Sec. 5001) This section reauthorizes a National Institutes of Health program to (1) develop and publish a priority list of needs in pediatric therapeutics, and (2) award funds to entities with expertise in conducting research regarding such needs.</p> <p>(Sec. 5002) This section reauthorizes through December 17, 2022, the humanitarian device exemption program, which authorizes the FDA to, for the purposes of an application for approval to market a medical device, waive certain effectiveness requirements for an eligible device designed to treat or diagnose a disease or condition that affects no more than 8,000 individuals in the United States.

The bill adds hate crimes, child abuse, and elder abuse as crimes that may qualify a victim for a U visa. &nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must provide work authorization to U visa applicants, whereas currently DHS may grant work authorization but is not required to do so.</p><p>The bill also eliminates the annual numerical cap on U visas.&nbsp;</p><p>The bill establishes a rebuttable presumption that certain individuals, including U visa applicants and T visa (victims of human trafficking) applicants, shall not be detained while the application is pending. </p><p>Additionally, the bill provides immigration-related protections, such as by extending the admission period and providing work authorization, to&nbsp;the spouse or child of a nonimmigrant visa holder who subjected that spouse or child to battery or extreme cruelty.</p><p>Further, the bill prohibits, with some exceptions for exigent circumstances, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or U.S. Customs and Border Protection from conducting immigration enforcement actions within 1,000 feet of a school, health care facility, place of worship, or other location specified in the

The FAA may require changes to the training program necessary to maintain standards across all ODA holders and unit members.</p><p>(Sec. 305) This section specifies that the FAA may not publicly disclose a report, data, or other information submitted to the FAA and related to the development, implementation, or use of an FAA-accepted Safety Management System (SMS). This includes a system required by regulation. (An SMS is a formal, organization-wide approach to safety risk that includes systematic procedures, practices, and policies.)</p><p>(Sec. 306) This section extends various reporting requirements and authorities in the Aircraft Certification, Safety, and Accountability Act through FY2028. For example, this section reauthorizes through FY2028 the Samya Rose Stumo National Air Grant Fellowship Program, which provides grants to graduate level students in aerospace- related fields to gain experience in how aviation legislation and policy are developed.</p><p>(Sec. 307) This section extends through FY2028 and modifies the authority of&nbsp;the FAA Executive Council to annually evaluate the FAA Compliance Program to assess the functioning and effectiveness of the program. As part of the annual evaluation, the FAA Executive Council must also assess (1) the need for long-term metrics that apply to all program offices, (2) if the program ensures the highest level of compliance with safety standards, (3) if the program has met its stated safety goals and purpose, and (4) FAA employee confidence in the program.</p><p>(Sec. 308) This section requires the FAA to consider the scalability of Safety Management System (SMS) requirements when conducting any rulemaking to require an SMS or implementing a regulatory requirement for SMS.

Under current law, the minimum safe altitude regulations allow for an exception from these requirements when it is necessary for takeoff or landing.</p><p>(Sec. 810) This section directs the FAA to prepare a report (with the advice of industry groups, including pilots, aircraft owners, and avionics manufacturers) on the development of a suitable position reporting system for voluntary use in certain airspace.</p><p>(Sec. 811) This section allows the FAA to coordinate with the General Aviation Joint Safety Committee to establish an Airshow Safety Team. The team must (1) analyze airshow and aerial event accidents and incidents; (2) publish and update every two years an Airshow Safety Plan; and (3) engage the airshow and aerial event community to communicate non-regulatory, proactive safety strategies and discuss best practices.</p><p>(Sec. 812) This section permits an aircraft to be operated on or after the expiration date on the aircraft’s certificate of registration as if it were not expired, so long as the operator is awaiting a pending registration renewal application and meets additional criteria.</p><p>(Sec. 813) This section permits an individual to obtain a temporary airman certificate (either electronic or physical) from the FAA while waiting for a requested permanent replacement airman certificate. An individual must destroy the temporary airman certificate upon receipt of the permanent replacement airman certificate.</p><p>(Sec. 814) This section excludes a flight instructor, registered owner, lessor, or lessee of a covered aircraft from having to obtain a letter of deviation authority from the FAA to allow, conduct, or receive flight training, checking, and testing in that aircraft in specific circumstances. These circumstances include if (1) the flight instructor is not providing both the training and the aircraft; (2) the aircraft is not advertised or broadly-offered for flight training, checking, or testing; and (3) no person receives compensation for use of the aircraft for a specific flight during which these services are received (other than expenses for owning, operating, and maintaining the aircraft). Covered aircraft are experimental category aircraft, limited category aircraft, and primary category aircraft.</p><p>(Sec. 815) This section allows a pilot examiner to administer a practical test or proficiency check under BasicMed if the examiner is otherwise qualified (i.e., meets the medical qualification requirements) to act as pilot in command of the covered aircraft (i.e., an aircraft that can carry not more than six people and has a maximum certificated takeoff weight of not more than 6,000 pounds).</p><p>As background, the BasicMed program is an alternate way for pilots to fly without holding an FAA medical certificate as long as they meet certain requirements.</p><p>(Sec. 816) This section requires the FAA to ensure that the designee locator search functions on the FAA's Designee Management System (DMS) public website have the necessary functionality. This includes the ability to (1) filter a designee search for an Aviation Medical Examiner by sex if such information is available; and (2) display the credentials, aircraft qualifications, and scheduling availability of a designated pilot examiner.

As part of the study, the GAO must consult with aviation stakeholder representatives and state and local governments.&nbsp;The GAO must submit a report to Congress&nbsp;on the study.</p><p>(Sec. 907) This section directs the FAA to review and evaluate the final rule titled <em>Remote Identification of Unmanned Aircraft</em>, issued on January 15, 2021, to determine whether unmanned aircraft manufacturers and operators can meet the rule's intent through alternative means of compliance, including through network–based remote identification. The FAA must submit a report to Congress&nbsp;on the results of the evaluation.</p><p>The 2021 FAA final rule&nbsp;generally requires most nonmilitary drones to broadcast position information and a unique identifier, referred to as Remote ID. This can be accomplished through built-in capabilities generally required for drones manufactured since September 2022, via Remote ID modules affixed to drones without built-in capabilities, or by operating within the confines of an FAA-recognized identification area (like a model aircraft park).</p><p>(Sec. 908) This section directs the FAA to adopt a performance-based and risk-based approach in reviewing specific waiver requests for the operation of small UAS. (A small unmanned aircraft weighs less than 55 pounds on takeoff.)</p><p>The FAA must improve the current established process to submit small UAS waiver requests. The section prohibits the FAA from requiring the use of open-ended descriptive prompts that must be filled out by an applicant, with exceptions.</p><p>Further, the FAA must leverage data gathered from previous waiver requests. If the FAA determines that a waiver application is substantially similar to a previously approved application, the FAA may streamline approval of the waiver application.</p><p>In determining whether to issue a waiver certificate, the FAA must (1) consider whether the waiver applicant has control over access to all real property on the ground within the area of the UAS's operation, and (2) account for the safety enhancements of such access.</p><p>The FAA must also establish an expedited review process for a request to modify or renew a waiver. The FAA must publish all issued waivers on the FAA website.</p><p>(Sec. 909) This section directs the FAA to publish UAS-specific environmental review guidance and implementation procedures. The guidance must include processes that allow for the prioritization of project applications and activities that (1) offset or limit the impacts of non-zero emission activities, (2) offset or limit the release of environmental pollutants to soil or water, or (3) demonstrate other factors that benefit human safety or the environment.</p><p>The FAA must also examine and integrate programmatic-level approaches to meeting the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA).</p><p>The FAA must periodically consult with the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to identify actions that are appropriate for a&nbsp;new categorical exclusion (CE) and incorporate such actions into the <em>FAA Order on Environmental Impacts: Policies and Procedures</em> to more easily allow for safe commercial operations of unmanned aircraft. (A CE is a class of actions that the FAA has determined, after review by CEQ, do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is normally required.)</p><p>Until the FAA finalizes the noise certification requirements for UAS, the FAA (1)&nbsp;must waive the determination of compliance with specific noise standards for an applicant seeking a&nbsp;UAS type and airworthiness certification; and (2)&nbsp;may not deny, withhold, or delay such certifications due to the absence of a noise certification&nbsp;if the FAA has developed appropriate noise measurement procedures for unmanned aircraft, and received from the applicant the noise measurement results based on such procedures.</p><p>The FAA must develop and establish substantive criteria and standard metrics to determine whether to approve an application for the airworthiness of an unmanned aircraft based on specific noise standards. In establishing the criteria and metrics, the FAA must include noise impacts.</p><p>The section also requires the FAA to (1) conduct certain environmental assessments related to&nbsp;UAS concurrently, and (2)&nbsp;allow for the engagement of approved specialized third parties to support the preparation and review of certain documentation related to NEPA requirements to ensure streamlined timelines for complex reviews.&nbsp;</p><p>(Sec. 910) This section requires the FAA, in coordination with the Forest Service and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, to develop a plan for the use of UAS by public entities in wildfire response efforts, including wildfire detection, mitigation, and suppression. The plan must provide recommendations to identify and designate public land areas with high potential for wildfires where public entities may conduct UAS operations beyond visual line of sight.</p><p>The FAA must publish the plan on the agency's website.</p><p>The FAA must also provide a liaison to the National Interagency Fire Center to facilitate the implementation of this plan and the use of manned and unmanned aircraft in wildfire response efforts.</p><p>(Sec. 911) This section directs DOT to establish a pilot program to supplement DOT inspection and oversight activities with UAS in order to increase employee safety, enhance data collection, increase the accuracy of inspections, and reduce costs. As a program participant, the FAA must evaluate the use of UAS to inspect ground-based aviation infrastructure, which may require visual inspection, in hard-to-reach areas (e.g., air traffic control towers and communication facilities).</p><p>DOT must provide Congress with annual briefings on the program. DOT must also submit a report to Congress on the final results of the pilot program.</p><p>Upon termination of the pilot program, DOT must assess the pilot program's results and determine whether to permanently incorporate the use of UAS into DOT's regular inspection, data collection, and oversight activities.</p><p>(Sec. 912) This section directs DOT to establish a UAS infrastructure inspection grant program to provide grants for the use of small UAS to support the inspection, operation, construction, maintenance, and repair of critical infrastructure.&nbsp;Governmental entities are eligible for these grants.

2025-05-20,Reported to House,House,House,One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"<p><strong>One Big Beautiful Bill Act</strong></p><p>This bill reduces taxes, reduces or increases spending for various federal programs, increases the statutory debt limit, and otherwise addresses agencies and programs throughout the federal government. &nbsp;</p><p>It is known as a reconciliation bill and includes legislation submitted by 11 House committees pursuant to provisions in the FY2025 congressional budget resolution (H Con. Res. 14) that directed the committees to submit legislation to the House Budget Committee that will increase or decrease the deficit and increase the statutory debt limit by specified amounts. (Reconciliation bills are considered by Congress using expedited legislative procedures that prevent a filibuster and restrict amendments in the Senate.)</p><p>TITLE I--COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE&nbsp;</p><p>This title addresses a wide range of Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs, including by changing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and extending programs authorized by the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (commonly known as the 2018 farm bill).</p><p>Subtitle A--Nutrition</p><p>(Sec. 10001) This section prohibits USDA from increasing the cost of the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) based on a reevaluation or update of the contents of the TFP (i.e., the market basket of goods). Further, any annual adjustment to the cost of the plan must be based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers.</p><p>As background, USDA created the&nbsp;TFP (the cost of purchasing a nutritionally adequate low-cost diet), which is used to determine maximum monthly benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). USDA calculates the cost of the TFP each year to account for food price inflation. Maximum allotments are set at the monthly cost of the TFP for a four-person family, adjusted for family size. Under a provision of the 2018 farm bill, USDA must reevaluate the market basket of goods every five years based on current food prices, food composition data, consumption patterns, and dietary guidance.&nbsp;</p><p>(Sec. 10002) This section expands the applicability of work requirements for SNAP recipients who are able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs). As background, these SNAP recipients have work-related requirements in addition to the general SNAP work registration and employment and training requirements.</p><p>Specifically, the section amends the exemptions to this requirement.</p><p>First, the section applies the work requirements for&nbsp;ABAWDs to adults who are not over 65 years old, whereas these requirements currently apply to adults who are not over 55 years old.</p><p>Second, the&nbsp;ABAWD exemption for a parent or household member with responsibility for a dependent child is restricted to a dependent child under the age of seven. Currently, the child must be under the age of 18.&nbsp;</p><p>This section includes an exception for a person who is (1) responsible for a dependent child who is seven years of age or older, and (2) married to and resides with an individual who complies with the SNAP work requirements.</p><p>In addition, the section specifies that current&nbsp;ABAWD exemptions set to sunset on October 1, 2030 will sunset. These exemptions from the ABAWD work requirements are for homeless individuals, veterans, and certain foster care individuals (those who are 24 years old or younger and were in foster care on the date of attaining 18 years of age or a higher age).</p><p>(Sec. 10003) This section modifies the&nbsp;ABAWD waiver program's&nbsp;allowable state exemptions. Under current law, an&nbsp;ABAWD waiver program allows state exemptions based on an area having an unemployment rate of over 10% or an insufficient number of jobs. The section amends the exemption to require the unemployment rate to be based on the rate for the county, instead of the area. Further, the section repeals the provision that allows a state exemption if that area does not have a sufficient number of jobs.</p><p>Under current law, a state agency may exempt up to 8% of SNAP recipients from the&nbsp;ABAWD work requirements for each fiscal year. This section reduces the percentage of exemptions a state agency may provide each year so that the average monthly number of exemptions does not exceed 1% of covered individuals (i.e., SNAP recipients and certain individuals who were denied SNAP benefits due to the work requirements).&nbsp;</p><p>(Sec. 10004) This section limits the availability of the Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) for determining SNAP income eligibility. Specifically, only households that include an elderly or disabled member may be considered automatically eligible for the SUA based on participation in the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) or a similar energy assistance program.&nbsp;</p><p>As background, when determining a household’s eligibility for SNAP, states consider the total shelter costs for a household, including the cost of utilities. States can use&nbsp;SUAs, which are standard amounts that represent low-income household utility costs in the state or local area. Currently, all LIHEAP participants who receive a minimum benefit are eligible for the SUA for determining SNAP income eligibility.</p><p>(Sec. 10005) This section prohibits household&nbsp;internet costs (e.g., monthly subscriber fees) from being used in computing the excess shelter expense deduction for the purposes of determining the size of household SNAP benefits.</p><p>(Sec. 10006) This section establishes state-matching fund requirements for the cost of SNAP program allotments. Currently, the state match is 0%. Beginning in FY2028, any state that has a payment error rate that is less than 6% must contribute a 5% match for the cost of SNAP program allotments.&nbsp;</p><p>A state with a payment error rate that is</p><ul><li>at least 6% but less than 8% must contribute 15%;</li><li>at least 8% but less than 10% must contribute 20%; and</li><li>10% or greater must contribute 25%.</li></ul><p>(Sec. 10007) This section reduces the amount that USDA may pay a state agency for administrative costs for the operation of SNAP to 25% of all administrative costs, from the current 50%, thereby increasing the state share of administrative costs from 50% to 75%.</p><p>(Sec. 10008) This section modifies the general work requirements of the SNAP program to cover individuals who are over the age of 17 and under the age of 65. Currently, the general work requirements apply to individuals who are over the age of 15 and under the age of 60. It also exempts parents or members of a household with responsibility for the care of a child who is under the age of seven (under the age of six under current law) from the requirements.&nbsp;</p><p>(Sec. 10009) This section requires state agencies (under the SNAP National Accuracy Clearinghouse) to use each indication of a multiple issuance of SNAP benefits to prevent multiple issuances of other federal and state assistance program benefits.</p><p>(Sec. 10010) This section reduces the tolerance level to $0 for a state to exclude small SNAP payment errors in the calculation of payment error rates.&nbsp;</p><p>As background, the SNAP quality control system measures how accurately SNAP state agencies determine a household’s eligibility and benefit amount and determines overpayments of benefits and underpayments. Under current law, the Food and Nutrition Service must set a tolerance level for excluding small payment errors in the calculation of payment error rates (e.g., $56 or less in FY2024). This section requires that the calculation of payment error rates include all SNAP payment errors.</p><p>(Sec. 10011) This section eliminates the SNAP Nutrition Education and Obesity Prevention Grant Program (SNAP-ED).</p><p>(Sec. 10012) This section limits SNAP benefits to individuals who reside in the United States and are (1) a citizen, or (2) an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence as an immigrant, with exceptions. Currently, SNAP eligibility extends to additional individuals who are classified as an alien under federal law, including an alien who has qualified for conditional entry under the asylum and refugee laws.</p><p>This section also extends funding for the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) through FY2031. TEFAP provides food commodities (and cash support for storage and distribution costs) through states to local emergency feeding organizations (e.g., food banks).</p><p>Subtitle B--Investment in Rural America</p><p>(Sec. 10101) This section amends and extends commodity support programs.</p><p>For example, the section extends the Price Loss Coverage Program, the Agricultural Risk Coverage Program, and Dairy Margin Coverage through crop year 2031.

2025-07-01,Passed Senate,House,Senate,One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"<p>This bill reduces taxes, reduces or increases spending for various federal programs, increases the statutory debt limit, and otherwise addresses agencies and programs throughout the federal government. &nbsp;</p><p>It is known as a reconciliation bill and includes legislation submitted by several congressional committees pursuant to provisions in the FY2025 congressional budget resolution (H Con. Res. 14) that directed the committees to submit legislation to the House or Senate Budget Committee that will increase or decrease the deficit and increase the statutory debt limit by specified amounts. (Reconciliation bills are considered by Congress using expedited legislative procedures that prevent a filibuster and restrict amendments in the Senate.)</p><p>TITLE I--COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, NUTRITION, AND FORESTRY</p><p>This title addresses a wide range of Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs, including by changing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and extending programs authorized by the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (commonly known as the 2018 farm bill).</p><p>Subtitle A--Nutrition</p><p>(Sec. 10101)&nbsp;This section prohibits USDA from increasing the cost of the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) based on a reevaluation of the contents of the TFP (i.e., the market basket of goods). Further, any annual adjustment to the cost of the plan must be based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers.</p><p>As background, USDA created the TFP (the cost of purchasing a nutritionally adequate low-cost diet), which is used to determine maximum monthly benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). USDA calculates the cost of the TFP each year to account for food price inflation. Maximum allotments are set at the monthly cost of the TFP for a four-person family, adjusted for family size. Under a provision of the 2018 farm bill, USDA must reevaluate the market basket of goods every five years based on current food prices, food composition data, consumption patterns, and dietary guidance.</p><p>(Sec. 10102)&nbsp;This section expands the applicability of work requirements for SNAP recipients who are able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs).</p><p>As background, these SNAP recipients have work-related requirements in addition to the general SNAP work registration and employment and training requirements. SNAP law limits benefits to ABAWDs to 3 months out of a 36-month period, unless the participant meets the additional work-related requirements.&nbsp;</p><p>Specifically, the section amends the exemptions to this requirement.</p><p>First, the section applies the work requirements for ABAWDs to adults who are not over 65 years old, whereas these requirements currently apply to adults who are not over 55 years old.</p><p>Second, the ABAWD exemption for a parent or household member with responsibility for a dependent child is restricted to&nbsp;a dependent child under the age of 14. Currently, those with a child&nbsp;under the age of 18 are exempt from the requirements.</p><p>This section includes an exception for individuals who are Indians, Urban Indians, or California Indians (as these terms are defined by the Indian Health Care Improvement Act).&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, the section eliminates the current exemptions from the ABAWD work requirements for homeless individuals, veterans, and certain foster care individuals (those who are 24 years old or younger and were in foster care on the date of attaining 18 years of age or a higher age).</p><p>Finally, this section modifies the ABAWD waiver program's allowable state exemptions. Under current law, an ABAWD waiver program allows state exemptions based on an area having an unemployment rate of over 10% or an insufficient number of jobs. The section allows Alaska and Hawaii to qualify for the state exemption with an unemployment rate that is at or above 1.5 times the national unemployment rate.&nbsp;Further, the section repeals the provision that allows a state exemption if that area does not have a sufficient number of jobs.</p><p>(Sec. 10103)&nbsp;This section limits the availability of the Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) for determining SNAP income eligibility. Specifically, only households that include an elderly or disabled member may be considered automatically eligible for the SUA based on participation in the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) or a similar energy assistance program.</p><p>As background, when determining a household’s eligibility for SNAP, states consider the total shelter costs for a household, including the cost of utilities. States can use SUAs, which are standard amounts that represent low-income household utility costs in the state or local area. Currently, all LIHEAP participants who receive a minimum benefit are eligible for the SUA for determining SNAP income eligibility.</p><p>(Sec.10104) This section prohibits any service fee associated with an internet connection&nbsp; from being used in computing the excess shelter expense deduction for the purposes of determining the size of household SNAP benefits.</p><p>(Sec. 10105) This section establishes state-matching fund requirements for the cost of SNAP program allotments&nbsp;beginning in FY2028. The state contribution ranges from 0% to 15% for the cost of SNAP program allotments and is based on the state’s SNAP payment error rate. Currently, the state match is 0%.</p><p>For FY2028, a state may elect either the FY2025 or FY2026 payment error rate to calculate its state-matching fund requirement. For FY2029 and each fiscal year thereafter, the state match is calculated using the payment error rate that is three fiscal years prior.</p><p>Any state that has a payment error rate that is less than 6% will have a state match of 0% (i.e., the state does not have to contribute).</p><p>A state with a payment error rate that is</p><ul><li>at least 6% but less than 8% must contribute 5%,</li><li>at least 8% but less than 10% must contribute 10%, and</li><li>10% or greater must contribute 15%.</li></ul><p>(Sec. 10106) This section reduces the amount that USDA may pay a state agency for administrative costs for the operation of SNAP to 25% of all administrative costs&nbsp;beginning in FY2027 and for each fiscal year thereafter. Currently, USDA must pay 50%&nbsp;of all administrative costs, thus this section increases&nbsp;the state share of administrative costs from 50% to 75%.</p><p>(Sec. 10107)&nbsp;This section eliminates&nbsp;funding for&nbsp;the SNAP Nutrition Education and Obesity Prevention Grant Program (SNAP-ED).</p><p>(Sec. 10108) This section limits SNAP benefits to individuals who reside in the United States and are (1) U.S. citizens or U.S. nationals; (2) aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence as an immigrant, with exceptions; (3) aliens who have been granted the status of Cuban or Haitian entrant; or (4) individuals who are lawfully residing in the United States in accordance with the Compacts of Free Association between the United States and Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau.</p><p>Currently, SNAP eligibility extends to additional individuals who are classified as an alien under federal law, including an alien who has qualified for conditional entry under the asylum and refugee laws.</p><p>Subtitle B-- Forestry</p><p>(Sec. 10201) This section rescinds certain funds provided to the Forest Service as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. For example, this includes the rescission of funds for&nbsp;</p><ul><li>the protection of old-growth forests on National Forest System land,</li><li>grants for nonfederal forest landowners for climate mitigation or forest resilience practices,</li><li>grants for state and private forestry conservation programs for tree planting, and</li><li>administrative costs for the National Forest System to implement these and other related programs.</li></ul><p>Subtitle C--Commodities</p><p>This subtitle amends and extends commodity support programs.</p><p>For example, the subtitle extends the Price Loss Coverage Program, the Agricultural Risk Coverage Program, and Dairy Margin Coverage through crop year 2031. It also modifies various requirements for the programs.</p><p>(Sec. 10313) This section provides for a number of changes to Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC), which include</p><ul><li>changing the definition of production history to remove the consideration of production at the time the dairy operation first registered to participate in the DMC program;</li><li>setting production history for the&nbsp;DMC program as the highest annual milk marketings for participating dairies during calendar year 2021, 2022, or 2023;</li><li>raising the coverage limit to the first 6 million pounds for both Tier I and Tier II premiums, from the first 5 million pounds; and</li><li>allowing producers to receive a 25% premium discount for a one-time premium election covering calendar years 2026-2031.</li></ul><p>Subtitle D--Disaster Assistance Programs</p><p>This subtitle expands the types of eligible losses covered under the permanently authorized agricultural disaster assistance programs, which include the Livestock Indemnity Program; the Livestock Forage Disaster Program; the&nbsp;Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program; and the&nbsp;Tree Assistance Program. This subtitle also increases coverage levels and lowers the threshold for triggering payments for certain eligible losses.</p><p>Subtitle&nbsp;E--Crop Insurance</p><p>This subtitle increases certain crop insurance premium subsidies and increases additional premium subsidies available for beginning farmers and ranchers. The subtitle also increases coverage levels for Supplemental Coverage Option and Whole Farm Revenue Protection policies, increases support for administrative and operating costs incurred by approved crop insurance providers, and increases funds available for program compliance and integrity.</p><p>In addition, this subtitle&nbsp;provides for the establishment of a Poultry Insurance Pilot Program in order to provide index-based insurance for contract poultry growers.</p><p>Subtitle F--Additional Investments in Rural America&nbsp;</p><p>(Sec. 10601) This section reauthorizes or modifies the funding levels for the following programs through FY2031:</p><ul><li>Agriculture Conservation Easement Program (ACEP),</li><li>Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP),</li><li>Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP),</li><li>Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP),</li><li>Grassroots Source Water Protection Program,</li><li>Voluntary Public Access and Habitat Incentive Program,</li><li>Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations Program, and</li><li>Feral Swine Eradication and Control Pilot Program.</li></ul><p>This section also rescinds the unobligated funds that were provided for the ACEP, EQIP, CSP, and RCPP conservation programs as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.</p><p>(Sec. 10602)&nbsp;This section directs USDA to carry out a program to encourage the accessibility, development, maintenance, and expansion of commercial export markets for U.S. agricultural commodities. This section also provides $285 million in mandatory funding for the program for FY2027 and each fiscal year thereafter.</p><p>(Sec. 10603)&nbsp;This section extends funding for the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) through FY2031. TEFAP provides food commodities (and cash support for storage and distribution costs) through states to local emergency feeding organizations (e.g., food banks).</p><p>(Sec. 10604)&nbsp;This section reauthorizes and provides funding for a number of USDA research initiatives.</p><p>For example, this section provides specified funds to the 1890 National Scholars Program for FY2026 for student scholarships. This National Institute of Food and Agriculture program provides grants to 1890 Institutions (i.e., historically Black colleges and universities that belong to the U.S. land-grant university system) for students who intend to pursue a career in the food and agricultural sciences.</p><p>This section provides the Specialty Crop Research Initiative with $175 million in mandatory funding for FY2026. Currently, the program is funded at $80 million for each fiscal year.</p><p>This section also provides funding for competitive grants to assist in the construction, alteration, acquisition, modernization, renovation, or remodeling of Agricultural Research Facilities.</p><p>(Sec. 10605)&nbsp;This section reauthorizes, and extends funding for, the bioenergy program for advanced biofuels (i.e., Advanced Biofuel Payment Program) through FY2031. The program provides payments to fuel producers to support and expand production of advanced biofuels (i.e., not derived from corn starch).</p><p>(Sec. 10606)&nbsp;This section provides additional funding for the Plant Pest and Disease Management Disaster Prevention Program for FY2026 and each fiscal year thereafter.</p><p>This section provides additional funding for the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program for FY2026 and each fiscal year thereafter. Under the block grant program, USDA provides grants to the state departments of agriculture to enhance the competitiveness of specialty crops (i.e., fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits, horticulture, and nursery crops, including floriculture).</p><p>The section also reauthorizes, and extends funding for, organic production and market data initiatives through FY2031.</p><p>This section reauthorizes, and extends funding through FY2026, for USDA to carry out the modernization and improvement of international trade technology systems and data collection on imports of organically produced agricultural products accepted into the United States.</p><p>The section also reauthorizes&nbsp;through FY2031&nbsp;the Organic Certification Cost Share Program, which provides cost share assistance to producers and handlers of agricultural products who are obtaining or renewing their certification under the National Organic Program.</p><p>This section reauthorizes, and extends funding through FY2026, for the multiple crop and pesticide use survey of farmers. The USDA Office of Pest Management Policy conducts this survey to collect data for risk assessment modeling and mitigation for an active ingredient.</p><p>(Sec. 10607) This section increases funding for the National Animal Health Laboratory Network. Specific increases in funding are also provided for the National Animal Disease Preparedness and Response Program and the National Animal Vaccine and Veterinary Countermeasures Bank.</p><p>This section extends and increases funding for the Sheep Production &amp; Marketing Grant Program through FY2026. This program seeks to strengthen and enhance the production and marketing of sheep and sheep products in the United States.</p><p>This section also extends the</p><ul><li>Pima Agriculture Cotton Trust Fund through December 31, 2031, which provides assistance to reduce the economic injury to domestic manufacturers resulting from tariffs on cotton fabric that are higher than tariffs on certain apparel articles made of cotton fabric;</li><li>Agriculture Wool Apparel Manufacturers Trust Fund through December 31, 2031, which provides assistance to reduce the economic injury to domestic manufacturers resulting from tariffs on wool fabric that are higher than tariffs on certain apparel articles made of wool fabric;</li><li>Wool Research and Promotion Program through FY2031, which provides grants to assist U.S. wool producers with improving the quality of wool and with developing and promoting the wool market;

Beginning on July 1, 2028, a borrower with a loan that is in a repayment status in accordance with, or an administrative forbearance associated with, an income-contingent repayment plan (e.g., current borrowers on the&nbsp;Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan) must begin repaying the loan under a new repayment plan. If a borrower does not select a plan, ED must enroll the borrower in either the Repayment Assistance Plan or the standard repayment plan.</p><p>(Sec. 82002) This section eliminates economic hardship and unemployment deferments beginning on July 1, 2027. It also reduces the total period a borrower may be in forbearance.</p><p>(Sec. 82003) This section allows borrowers to rehabilitate a defaulted loan twice (currently, only once).

2025-07-04,Public Law,House,Unknown,One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"<p>This act reduces taxes, reduces or increases spending for various federal programs, increases the statutory debt limit, and otherwise addresses agencies and programs throughout the federal government. &nbsp;</p><p>It is known as a reconciliation bill and includes legislation submitted by several congressional committees pursuant to provisions in the FY2025 congressional budget resolution (H Con. Res. 14) that directed the committees to submit legislation to the House or Senate Budget Committee that will increase or decrease the deficit and increase the statutory debt limit by specified amounts. (Reconciliation bills are considered by Congress using expedited legislative procedures that prevent a filibuster and restrict amendments in the Senate.)</p><p>TITLE I--COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, NUTRITION, AND FORESTRY</p><p>This title addresses a wide range of Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs, including by changing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and extending programs authorized by the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (commonly known as the 2018 farm bill).</p><p>Subtitle A--Nutrition</p><p>(Sec. 10101)&nbsp;This section prohibits USDA from increasing the cost of the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) based on a reevaluation of the contents of the TFP (i.e., the market basket of goods). Further, any annual adjustment to the cost of the plan must be based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers.</p><p>As background, USDA created the TFP (the cost of purchasing a nutritionally adequate low-cost diet), which is used to determine maximum monthly benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). USDA calculates the cost of the TFP each year to account for food price inflation. Maximum allotments are set at the monthly cost of the TFP for a four-person family, adjusted for family size. Under a provision of the 2018 farm bill, USDA must reevaluate the market basket of goods every five years based on current food prices, food composition data, consumption patterns, and dietary guidance.</p><p>(Sec. 10102) This section increases the work requirements for certain SNAP recipients&nbsp;who are able-bodied adults.</p><p>As background,&nbsp;SNAP recipients who are able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs) currently have work-related requirements in addition to the general SNAP work registration and employment and training requirements. SNAP law limits benefits to ABAWDs to 3 months out of a 36-month period, unless the participant meets the additional work-related requirements.</p><p>This section raises the age for those who must meet these additional work requirements to include adults who are 65 years old and younger, whereas these requirements currently apply to adults who are 55 years old and younger.</p><p>This section requires parents and household members to meet the additional work requirements (similar to someone who does not have a dependent child) if the child is age 14 and older. Currently, those with a child under the age of 18 are exempt from the requirements.</p><p>This section&nbsp;excludes from the additional work requirements SNAP recipients who are Indians, Urban Indians, or California Indians (as these terms are defined by the Indian Health Care Improvement Act).&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, the section generally requires homeless individuals, veterans, and certain foster care individuals&nbsp;to meet these work requirements. Foster care individuals are&nbsp;those who are 24 years old or younger and were in foster care on the date of attaining 18 years of age or a higher age.&nbsp;Specifically, this section eliminates the current exclusion from the additional work requirements for these individuals based on this status.</p><p>Finally, this section limits the ability of a state to temporarily suspend the three-month time limit for SNAP benefits for ABAWDS in areas with high unemployment or an insufficient number of jobs. Under current law, the ABAWD waiver program allows states to request a temporary waiver of the three-month SNAP benefit limit. States may receive a waiver based on an area having an unemployment rate of over 10% or an insufficient number of jobs.</p><p>The section repeals the provision that allows a state waiver if that area does not have a sufficient number of jobs. Further, the section allows Alaska and Hawaii to qualify for the state exemption with an unemployment rate that is at or above 1.5 times the national unemployment rate, effectively lowering the unemployment rate that these states must meet to receive a waiver.&nbsp;</p><p>(Sec. 10103) This section generally eliminates the ability of a household to use participation in certain energy assistance programs to determine SNAP income eligibility unless&nbsp;the household includes an elderly or disabled member.&nbsp;</p><p>As background, a household may deduct a portion of their housing and utility costs from their income (i.e., the excess shelter expense deduction) when determining SNAP benefits. Under current law, a household that receives a certain level of energy assistance through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) or a similar energy assistance program may deduct a set allowance. This set allowance&nbsp;(i.e., Standard Utility Allowance or SUA) represents low-income household utility costs in the state or local area. Using this allowance makes qualifying for an excess shelter deduction more likely.</p><p>This section&nbsp;eliminates the use of the set allowance for households without elderly or disabled members, which may decrease the availability of the excess shelter deduction and reduce the SNAP benefits for these households.</p><p>(Sec.&nbsp;10104)&nbsp;This section prohibits a household from using any internet connection service fees as part of their housing and utility costs for the purposes of determining the size of household SNAP benefits, thus potentially reducing the SNAP benefits for these households.</p><p>As background, a household may deduct a portion of their housing and utility costs from their income (i.e., the excess shelter expense&nbsp;deduction) when determining SNAP benefits.&nbsp;Under current law, household expenses may include&nbsp;internet connection service fees.</p><p>(Sec. 10105) This section establishes state-matching fund requirements for the cost of SNAP program allotments&nbsp;beginning in FY2028. The state contribution ranges from 0% to 15% for the cost of SNAP program allotments and is based on the state’s SNAP payment error rate. Currently, the state match is 0%.</p><p>For FY2028, a state may elect either the FY2025 or FY2026 payment error rate to calculate its state-matching fund requirement. For FY2029 and each fiscal year thereafter, the state match is calculated using the payment error rate for the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the state share is being calculated.</p><p>Any state that has a payment error rate that is less than 6% will have a state match of 0% (i.e., the state does not have to contribute).&nbsp;</p><p>A state with a payment error rate that is</p><ul><li>at least 6% but less than 8% must contribute 5%,</li><li>at least 8% but less than 10% must contribute 10%, and</li><li>10% or greater must contribute 15%.</li></ul><p>In general,&nbsp;the&nbsp;effective date for the state-matching fund requirements&nbsp;is the beginning of FY2028. However, any state that has an error rate above a certain level will have implementation delayed until FY2029 or&nbsp;FY2030. Specifically, the implementation date is delayed for states where the state's error rate multiplied by 1.5 equals or exceeds 20% in FY2025 or FY2026. For such states, the implementation date is delayed until FY2029 if the specified error rate occurs in FY2025 and until FY2030 if the error rate occurs in FY2026.&nbsp;</p><p>(Sec. 10106) This section reduces the amount that USDA may pay a state agency for administrative costs for the operation of SNAP to 25% of all administrative costs beginning in FY2027 and for each fiscal year thereafter. Currently, USDA must pay 50% of all administrative costs, thus this section increases the state share of administrative costs from 50% to 75%.</p><p>(Sec. 10107) This section eliminates funding for the SNAP Nutrition Education and Obesity Prevention Grant Program (SNAP-ED). SNAP state and local agencies administer this federal grant program. SNAP-Ed uses evidence-based, public health projects and interventions with the goal to implement a nutrition education and obesity prevention program for eligible individuals that promotes healthy food choices and physical activity consistent with the most recent Dietary Guidelines for Americans.</p><p>(Sec. 10108) This section&nbsp;eliminates SNAP eligibility for certain individuals who are classified as an alien under federal law and legally present in the United States, including those who have qualified for conditional entry under the asylum and refugee laws or&nbsp;based on urgent humanitarian&nbsp;reasons (e.g., a&nbsp;survivor of domestic violence or human trafficking).</p><p>The section maintains SNAP eligibility for&nbsp;individuals who reside in the United States and are (1) U.S. citizens or U.S. nationals; (2) lawful permanent residents, with exceptions; (3) aliens who are Cuban or Haitian&nbsp;entrants; or (4) individuals who are lawfully residing in the United States in accordance with the Compacts of Free Association between the United States and Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and&nbsp;Palau.</p><p>Subtitle B-- Forestry</p><p>(Sec. 10201) This section rescinds certain funds provided to the Forest Service as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. For example, this includes the rescission of funds for&nbsp;</p><ul><li>the protection of old-growth forests on National Forest System land,</li><li>grants for nonfederal forest landowners for climate mitigation or forest resilience practices,</li><li>grants for state and private forestry conservation programs for tree planting, and</li><li>administrative costs for the National Forest System to implement these and other related programs.</li></ul><p>Subtitle C--Commodities</p><p>This subtitle amends and extends commodity support programs.</p><p>For example, the subtitle extends the Price Loss Coverage (PLC) program, the Agricultural Risk Coverage (ARC)&nbsp; program, and Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) through crop year 2031. It also modifies various requirements for the programs.</p><p>(Sec. 10301) This section increases the reference prices for specified commodities under the ARC and&nbsp;PLC programs for crop years 2025 through 2030. This change would increase the likelihood of triggering a payment and increase the payments made to eligible producers when triggered.</p><p>Beginning in crop year 2031, USDA must increase the reference price so that it is equal to the reference price in the previous crop year multiplied by 1.005. USDA must continue to increase the reference price using this formula for each crop year after 2031, up to a maximum of 113% of the 2030 reference price.</p><p>The ARC and&nbsp;PLC programs, administered by the Farm Service Agency, offer financial assistance to eligible agricultural producers, and the reference prices are used to calculate benefits under the programs.&nbsp;The ARC program is an income support program that provides payments to producers triggered when actual crop revenue declines below a specified guarantee level. The&nbsp;PLC program provides income support payments triggered when the effective price for a covered commodity falls below its effective reference price.</p><p>(Sec. 10302) This section grants eligible agricultural producers a one-time option to expand and allocate base acre holdings in proportion to average 2019-2023 plantings of covered and&nbsp;noncovered commodities. In general, the Price Loss Coverage and Agriculture Risk Coverage programs make payments per enrolled base acre (i.e., a unit of production associated with specific tracts of farmland in proportion to historical production of certain crops).</p><p>This section allows producers to allocate existing unassigned base acres to a covered commodity. The section limits the total existing unassigned and newly granted base acres to no more than 30 million acres, effectively increasing total base acres nationwide from approximately 274 million to approximately 304 million.</p><p>(Sec. 10303)&nbsp;This section requires producers to make an election to obtain ARC or PLC on a covered-commodity-by-covered commodity basis through crop year 2031.&nbsp;For the 2025 crop year, this section requires USDA, on a covered commodity-by-covered commodity basis, to make the higher of PLC payments or ARC county coverage payments to the producers on a farm for the payment acres for each covered commodity on the&nbsp;farm.</p><p>(Sec. 10304) This section extends the&nbsp;PLC program through crop year 2031.</p><p>(Sec. 10305) This section extends the ARC program through the 2031 crop year. It also increases the coverage guarantee level from 86% to 90% of the benchmark revenue and increases the maximum payment amount&nbsp;from 10% to 12.5% of the&nbsp;benchmark revenue. These changes increase the likelihood of triggering a payment and increase the payments made to eligible producers when triggered. &nbsp;</p><p>(Sec. 10306) This section establishes a definition for a qualified pass-through entity, which includes certain partnerships and S corporations (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code) and certain limited liability companies, joint ventures, and general partnerships. It also generally requires these entities to be treated in the same manner as current law treats general partnerships and joint ventures for the purpose of payment limitations. For example, the section replaces an existing exception to payment limitations for joint ventures and general partnerships with an exception for qualified pass-through entities.</p><p>(Sec. 10307) This section increases the maximum ARC and&nbsp;PLC&nbsp;payment limit per person from $125,000 to $155,000. A producer is eligible to receive up to $155,000 in peanut payments and up to $155,000 in payments for all commodities except peanuts (i.e., up to $310,000 total for all commodities inclusive). USDA must adjust payment limits for inflation annually beginning with the 2025 crop year.</p><p>As background, certain payment limits and eligibility criteria apply to multiple farm programs, including ARC,&nbsp;PLC, and certain disaster assistance programs and conservation programs.</p><p>(Sec. 10308) This section waives the adjusted gross income (AGI) limitations for payments or benefits under certain USDA disaster assistance and conservation programs for a person or legal entity that derives a portion of their income from agriculture. Specifically, the exception allows producers and business entities whose AGI exceeds $900,000 to participate in certain disaster assistance and conservation programs if 75% or more of their AGI (i.e., gross income before applying adjustments to calculate the AGI) is derived from eligible agricultural activities.</p><p>The eligible activities are farming, ranching, or siviculture activities, including&nbsp;agritourism, direct-to-consumer marketing of agricultural products, and the sale of agricultural equipment owned by such person or entity.</p><p>(Sec. 10309) This section extends the Marketing Assistance Loan (MAL) program nonrecourse and recourse loans through the 2031 crop year. It also sets MAL rates for crop years 2026-2031. This section also extends Loan Deficiency Payments (LDPs) through the 2031 crop year. The MAL and LDP programs provide price support to producers when market prices drop below statutory levels.</p><p>This section also extends the Special Competitive Provisions for Extra Long Staple (ELS) Cotton program. This program makes payments to eligible mills that use ELS cotton and eligible exporters of ELS cotton.</p><p>As background, there are two main species of cotton cultivated for commercial use, upland cotton (which comprises 97% of U.S. production) and extra-long staple (ELS) cotton. U.S.-grown ELS cotton is also referred to as Pima cotton.</p><p>(Sec. 10310) This section changes how world prices for upland and ELS cotton are calculated for the purpose of repaying&nbsp;MALs.</p><p>(Sec. 10311) This section increases the payments to domestic users of upland cotton who participate in the Economic Adjustment Assistance for Textile Mills program. This program makes monthly payments to eligible domestic cotton mills. The payments must be used for capital investments that contribute to domestic manufacturing of upland cotton.</p><p>(Sec. 10312) This section makes several modification to USDA's sugar program.&nbsp;As background, the U.S. sugar program supports the U.S. sugar industry (i.e., producers and processors of sugarcane and sugar beets) by providing Marketing Assistance Loans (MALs) to sugar processors, restricting domestic supply of sugar with marketing allotments for sugar processors, and limiting sugar imports through tariff-rate quotas.</p><p>Specifically, this section increases the marketing loan rate for raw sugar cane processors and increases the rate for beet sugar processors for crop years 2025-2031.</p><p>This section also increases the storage rates USDA pays to processors for forfeited refined sugar and forfeited raw cane sugar. Under current law, when sugar is used to&nbsp;collateralize a MAL loan and is forfeited by a sugar processor, USDA must provide payments to the processors who store the forfeited sugar.</p><p>This section extends the provisions for the flexible marketing allotments for sugar through crop year 2031. In addition, in operating sugar support programs, USDA must prioritize sugar beet processors if marketing allotments are adjusted higher. Additionally, if sugar beet marketing allotments need to be adjusted, USDA must reassign sugar beet marketing allotments within 30 days of the publication of USDA's January World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, USDA must study whether the establishment of additional terms and conditions with respect to refined sugar imports is necessary and appropriate and submit a report to Congress. Based on the study, USDA may issue regulations to establish additional terms and conditions for refined sugar imports.</p><p>(Sec. 10313) This section extends Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) through crop year 2031 and provides for a number of changes to the DMC program.</p><p>As background, DMC allows participating milk producers to buy a guaranteed margin for their milk production.&nbsp;The DMC program pays participating producers the difference between a producer-selected guarantee and the national milk margin (all-milk price minus an average feed cost ration). Margin payments are based on producers' milk production history, not actual milk marketings (i.e., quantity of milk sold). Producers pay annual premium rates based on two tiers of production history.</p><p>Changes to the program include</p><ul><li>altering how USDA determines&nbsp;production history to remove the consideration of production at the time the dairy operation first registered to participate in the DMC program;</li><li>setting production history for the DMC program as the highest annual milk marketings for participating dairies during calendar year 2021, 2022, or 2023;</li><li>raising the coverage limit to the first 6 million pounds of production history for both Tier I and Tier II premiums, from the first 5 million pounds; and</li><li>allowing producers to receive a 25% premium discount for a one-time premium election covering calendar years 2026-2031.</li></ul><p>(Sec. 10314)&nbsp; This section requires USDA to make available specified funds to carry out this subtitle. It also requires USDA to use specified funds to administer a mandatory survey of dairy product manufacturers' production costs and product yield information. USDA must&nbsp;publish the results of the surveys&nbsp;biennially.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Subtitle D--Disaster Assistance Programs</p><p>This subtitle expands the types of eligible losses covered under the permanently authorized agricultural disaster assistance programs, which include the Livestock Indemnity Program; the Livestock Forage Disaster Program; the&nbsp;Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program; and the&nbsp;Tree Assistance Program. This subtitle also increases coverage levels and lowers the threshold for triggering payments for certain eligible losses.</p><p>(Sec. 10401) Under the Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP), this section increases the payment rate to 100%, from 75%, for losses due to predation (i.e., attacks by animals reintroduced into the wild by the federal government or protected by federal law). This section also authorizes USDA to allow eligible producers to submit documentation to assist in determining an animal's market value. Further, the section expands LIP coverage to include unborn livestock as LIP- eligible livestock losses. LIP provides indemnity payments to eligible livestock owners and contract growers for livestock deaths in excess of normal mortality or reduced sales prices due to specified events (e.g., adverse weather, disease, or animal attack).</p><p>Under the Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP), this section expands the types of eligible drought conditions covered and increases payments for certain eligible drought conditions under the program. The LFP program makes payments to eligible livestock producers who have suffered grazing losses due to&nbsp;drought-affected pastureland&nbsp;or a fire on federally managed rangelands.</p><p>Under the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP), this section expands eligible losses to include bird predation of farm-raised fish and adds an eligible loss threshold when determining honey bee colony losses. ELAP provides payments to producers of livestock, honey bees, and farm-raised fish as compensation for losses due to disease, adverse weather, feed or water shortages, or other conditions that are not covered under other programs.</p><p>Under the Tree Assistance Program (TAP), this section lowers the eligible normal mortality loss threshold and increases assistance for eligible rehabilitation costs. TAP provides financial assistance to qualifying orchardists and nursery tree growers to replant or rehabilitate eligible trees, bushes, and vines damaged by natural disasters.</p><p>Subtitle&nbsp;E--Crop Insurance</p><p>This subtitle increases certain crop insurance premium subsidies and increases additional premium subsidies available for beginning farmers and ranchers. The subtitle also increases coverage levels for Supplemental Coverage Option&nbsp;(i.e., a type of county-level coverage) and Whole Farm Revenue Protection policies, increases support for administrative and operating (A&amp;O) costs incurred by approved crop insurance providers, and increases funds available for program compliance and integrity.</p><p>As background, the Federal Crop Insurance Program (FCIP) offers subsidized crop insurance policies that producers can purchase to cover a wide variety of crops and livestock. These policies pay indemnities for yield and revenue losses caused by adverse growing and market conditions, including natural disasters. The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC)—a government corporation within USDA—subsidizes part of the policy premium.</p><p>(Sec. 10501) This section increases the premium subsidies available for beginning farmers or ranchers for an applicable insurance policy or plan.</p><p>Further, farmers and ranchers are eligible to qualify for the program for 10 years, an increase from 5 years. Specifically, a farmer or rancher must not have actively operated and managed a farm or ranch for more than 10 crop years to be considered a beginning farmer or rancher.&nbsp;</p><p>(Sec. 10502) This section expands the maximum coverage level from 85% to 90% for individual yield or revenue coverage aggregated across multiple commodities (e.g., Whole-Farm Revenue Protection policies). &nbsp;</p><p>The section also expands the&nbsp;Supplemental Coverage Option (SCO) and increases SCO premium subsidies from 65% to 80%. It also increases the SCO coverage level from 86% to 90%.</p><p>(Sec. 10503) This section increases administrative and operating (A&amp;O) subsidies in certain states and years with relatively high losses.</p><p>As background, the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) subsidizes part of the policy premium. The policyholders (i.e., farmers and ranchers)&nbsp;pay any remaining premium. Private insurance companies&nbsp;sell and service the policies in return for A&amp;O subsidies from the FCIC.</p><p>This section also establishes a minimum A&amp;O reimbursement&nbsp;rate for specialty crop policies&nbsp;each year beginning in the 2026 reinsurance year. The rate must be equal to or greater than the percentage that is the greater of (1) 17% of the premium used to define loss ratio, and (2) the percentage of the premium used to define loss ratio that is otherwise applicable for the reinsurance year under the terms of the Standard Reinsurance Agreement in effect for the reinsurance year.</p><p>Finally, beginning with the 2026 reinsurance year, the section requires&nbsp;USDA to annually increase the total A&amp;O reimbursements that would otherwise be required in order to account for inflation.</p><p>(Sec. 10504) This section increases certain crop insurance premium subsidies. The increases range from 3% to 5%, depending on the coverage level.</p><p>(Sec. 10505) This section increases funding for available information technologies (i.e., data mining and data warehousing) to administer and enforce program compliance and integrity.</p><p>(Sec. 10506) This section increases funding for (1) the operations and review of policies, plans of insurance, and related materials; and&nbsp;(2) maintaining program actuarial soundness and financial integrity.&nbsp;</p><p>(Sec. 10507) This section provides for the establishment of a Poultry Insurance Pilot Program to provide contract poultry growers with&nbsp;index-based insurance for&nbsp;extreme weather-related risk resulting in increased utility costs&nbsp;associated with poultry production. Under an index policy, claim payments are generally triggered based on a predetermined index that is entirely independent of the individual farm operation (e.g., rainfall level). Under such a policy, the payments are automatically triggered when the index reaches a certain level rather than when an insured farmer files a claim.</p><p>Subtitle F--Additional Investments in Rural America&nbsp;</p><p>(Sec. 10601) This section rescinds the unobligated funds that were provided for the Agriculture Conservation Easement Program (ACEP), the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP), and the Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP)&nbsp; as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

(Some exclusions apply.)</p><p>Further, under this section (1) small business taxpayers (with average annual gross receipts of $31 million or less) may claim a tax deduction for domestic research and experimental expenses retroactively to tax years beginning after December 31, 2021, and (2) taxpayers may elect to accelerate amortization attributable to domestic research and experimental expenditures paid or incurred after December 31, 2021 and before January 1, 2025.</p><p>(Sec. 70303) This section reinstates the exclusion of the tax deduction for depreciation, amortization, or depletion from the calculation of adjusted taxable income for purposes of the limitation on the tax deduction for interest expenses for tax years beginning after December 31, 2024.</p><p>This section also expands the exclusion of interest on floor plan financing from the limit on the tax deduction for business interest expenses to include interest on floor plan financing of any camper or trailer designed to (1) provide temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, or seasonal use; and (2) be towed by, or affixed to, a motor vehicle.</p><p>(Sec. 70304) This section makes permanent the business tax credit for paid family and medical leave and allows employers to base the tax credit on certain wages or premiums paid.</p><p>Specifically, under this section, an eligible employer may claim a tax credit beginning in 2026, as part of the general business tax credit, for up to 25% of either (1) wages paid to qualifying employees during any period that such employees are on family and medical leave, or (2) the total amount of premiums paid or incurred for insurance policies that provide paid family and medical leave for employees. (As background, for 2018-2025, an eligible employer may claim a tax credit as part of the general business tax credit for up to 25% of wages paid to qualifying employees during any period that such employees are on family and medical leave.)</p><p>(Sec. 70305) This section provides multiple exceptions to the limitation imposed on the tax deduction for employer-provided meals.&nbsp;</p><p>Specifically, an employer generally may not deduct certain expenses paid or incurred after 2025 for (1) providing food or beverages to employees through an eating facility (operated by the employer for employees) that meets the de&nbsp;minimis requirements for fringe benefits (e.g., office snacks and coffee), or (2) meals provided by the employer for the convenience of the employer on the employer’s premises to employees and their spouses and dependents. (As background, de minimis fringe benefits are benefits that are so small as to make accounting for them unreasonable or impractical.)</p><p>However, under this section, an employer may continue to deduct such expenses if</p><ul><li>sold to customers (including employees) for adequate and full consideration,</li><li>required to be provided under federal law by the employer to the crew of a commercial vessel,</li><li>provided by the employer to the crew of a fishing vessel, or</li><li>provided to employees of certain fishing processing facilities in Alaska that are not located in a metropolitan area.</li></ul><p>(Sec. 70306) This section increases to $2.5 million (from $1.25 million in 2025 and adjusted annually for inflation) the maximum amount that may be deducted (expensed) for certain depreciable business assets. This section also increases to $4 million (from $3.13 million in 2025 and adjusted annually for inflation) the dollar amount at which the tax deduction begins to phase out. Both amounts continue to be annually adjusted for inflation.</p><p>(Sec. 70307) This section provides for an elective 100% depreciation allowance for nonresidential real property that is placed into service before January 1, 2031, and that meets certain other requirements. (Some limitations apply.)</p><p>(Sec. 70308) This section increases the advance manufacturing tax credit to 35% (from 25%) for property placed into service after December 31, 2025.</p><p>(Sec. 70309) This section expands the exclusion from gross income for interest on certain bonds issued by state or local governments (specifically tax-exempt facility bonds) to include interest on bonds for which at least 95% of the net proceeds are used to finance a spaceport. (Thus, spaceports are treated in the same manner as airports for purposed of the federal tax-exempt facility bond rules.)</p><p>Under this section, a spaceport is defined as any facility located at or in close proximity to a launch site or reentry site used for</p><ul><li>manufacturing, assembling, or repairing spacecraft, space cargo;</li><li>flight control operations;</li><li>providing launch services and reentry services; or</li><li>transferring crew, spaceflight participants, or space cargo to or from spacecraft.</li></ul><p>Further, this section provides that a tax-exempt facility bond is not considered federally guaranteed because an agency of the U.S. government is paying rent, fees, or charges for the use of the spaceport. (As background, state and local bonds that are federally guaranteed are not tax-exempt unless an exception applies.)</p><p>Subchapter B--Permanent America-First International Tax Reforms</p><p>Part I--Foreign Tax Credit</p><p>This part makes multiple changes to the foreign tax credit.</p><p>Below is a summary of the provisions in this part.</p><p>(Sec. 70311) This section limits the tax deductions a domestic corporate shareholder may allocate to net CFC tested income (formerly known as global intangible taxable income [GILTI] and renamed under Section 70323 of this act) for purposes of determining the limit on the foreign tax credit.&nbsp;(In this context, CFC refers to controlled foreign corporation.)</p><p>Specifically, under this section, a domestic corporation may allocate to net CFC tested income (1) the tax deduction for 40% of the net CFC tested income amount included by such corporation in gross income and amounts treated as dividends attributable to such amounts, and (2) any other deduction directly allocable to such income.</p><p>Further, under this section, interest expenses and research and development expenses paid by a domestic corporate shareholder may not be apportioned to net CFC tested income.</p><p>(Sec. 70312) This section increases the tax credit allowed to a domestic corporation for income taxes paid by a controlled foreign corporation attributable to income included by the corporation as subpart F income and net CFC tested income (formerly known as GILTI and renamed under Section 70323 of this act).&nbsp;</p><p>Under this section, for tax years beginning in 2026, a domestic corporation is allowed a foreign tax credit of up to 90% of the foreign income taxes that are paid or accrued by a controlled foreign corporation of which the domestic corporation is a shareholder and that are attributable to CFC tested income. (For tax years beginning before 2026, a domestic corporation generally is allowed a foreign tax credit of up to 80% of such foreign income taxes paid or accrued.)&nbsp;</p><p>As background, the allowance of a tax credit for only a percentage of the foreign taxes paid or accrued on net CFC tested income is also known as the foreign tax credit haircut. Thus, under this section, the foreign tax credit haircut is decreased to 10% (from 20%).</p><p>This section also applies the 10% foreign tax credit haircut to foreign income taxes paid or accrued on &nbsp;distributions of previously taxed net CFC tested income.</p><p>(Sec. 70313) This section allows a percentage of the income from the sale of certain inventory to be treated as foreign-sourced income for purposes of calculating the foreign tax credit.</p><p>Specifically, under this section, a U.S. person may treat as foreign-sourced income up to 50% of the income from the sale of inventory produced in the United States (for use outside of the United States) that is attributable to a foreign office or fixed place of business outside of the United States.&nbsp;</p><p>Part II--Foreign-Derived Deduction Eligible Income and Net&nbsp;CFC Tested Income</p><p>This part makes multiple changes to the tax deduction allowed to a domestic corporation for foreign-derived intangible income and GILTI.</p><p>Below is a summary of the provisions in the part.</p><p>(Sec. 70321) This section increases the tax deduction allowed to a domestic corporation for foreign-derived deduction eligible income (formerly known as foreign-derived intangible income and renamed under Section 70323 of this act)&nbsp;and net CFC tested income (formerly known as GILTI and renamed under Section 70323 of this act).</p><p>Under this section, for tax years beginning in 2026, a domestic corporation generally may claim a tax deduction equal to the sum of (1) 33.34% of such corporation’s foreign-derived deduction eligible income, and (2) 40% of such corporation’s net CFC tested income.</p><p>As background, for tax years beginning after 2017 and before 2026,&nbsp;a domestic corporation generally is allowed a tax deduction equal to the sum of (1) 37.5% of such corporation’s foreign-derived intangible income, and (2) 50% of such corporation’s GILTI. As enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and prior to modification by this section, the deduction decreased starting in 2026, to the sum of (1) 21.875% of such corporation’s foreign-derived intangible income, and (2) 37.5% of such corporation’s GILTI and amounts treated as dividends attributable to such amounts.</p><p>(Sec. 70322) This section excludes gain from the sale or disposition of certain property&nbsp;from the calculation of the tax deduction for foreign-derived deduction eligible income.</p><p>Specifically, under this section, deduction eligible income (for purposes of the tax deduction for foreign-derived deduction eligible income) may not include&nbsp;gain from the sale or other disposition (including the deemed sale or other disposition) occurring after June 16, 2025, of (1) property of a type that gives rise to rents or royalties, and (2) any other property that is subject to depreciation, amortization, or depletion by the seller of such property.</p><p>Further, under this section, deduction&nbsp;eligible income must be reduced by expenses and deductions directly related to such income.</p><p>(Sec. 70323) This section eliminates the use of a domestic corporation’s deemed tangible income return in determining foreign-derived intangible income and such corporation’s net deemed tangible income return in determining GILTI. As a result, under this section, the term foreign-derived intangible income is renamed foreign-derived deduction eligible income and the term GILTI is renamed net CFC tested income.</p><p>Part III--Base Erosion Minimum Tax</p><p>This part makes changes to the base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT).</p><p>Below is a summary of the provision in this part.</p><p>(Sec. 70331) This section decreases the BEAT rate to 10.5% (from 12.5%) for tax years beginning after 2025. (Prior to amendment by this section, the BEAT rate wass 10% for 2025 and 12.5% for tax years after 2025.)</p><p>Part IV--Business Interest Limitation</p><p>This part makes changes to the calculation of the limitation on the tax deduction of business interest expenses. Under current law, the tax deduction for business interest expenses is limited to the sum of (1) business interest income for the tax year in which the tax deduction is being claimed, (2) 30% of the taxpayer’s adjusted taxable income, and (3) the taxpayer’s floor plan financing interest.</p><p>Below is a summary of the provisions in this part.</p><p>(Sec. 70341) This section provides that the&nbsp;limitation on tax deduction of business interest is calculated before capitalizable interest is calculated. (Some exceptions apply.)</p><p>(Sec. 70342) This section excludes subpart F income and net CFC tested income (formerly known as GILTI and renamed under section 70323 of this act) from adjusted taxable income for purposes of calculating limitation on tax deduction of business interest.</p><p>Part V--Other International Tax Reforms</p><p>This part makes permanent and modifies multiple federal tax provisions that impact foreign corporations.</p><p>Below is a summary of the key provisions in this part.</p><p>(Sec. 70351) This section permanently extends the CFC look-through rule. (Under the CFC look-through rule, certain interest expenses, dividends, rents, and royalties received by one CFC from a related CFC are not treated as foreign personal holding company income [for purposes of calculating subpart F income] if certain other requirements are met.)</p><p>(Sec. 70352) This section requires a specified foreign corporation (generally a CFC or any foreign corporation with respect to which one or more domestic corporations is a U.S. shareholder) to use the taxable year of their majority U.S. shareholder , effective for tax years beginning after November 30, 2025. (For tax years beginning on or before November 30, 2025, a specified foreign corporation may elect a tax year beginning one month earlier than the majority U.S. shareholder.)</p><p>Chapter 4--Investing in American Families, Communities, and Small Businesses</p><p>Subchapter A--Permanent Investments in Families and Children</p><p>This subchapter makes multiple changes to federal tax provisions related to children and dependents.</p><p>Below is a summary of the provisions in this subchapter.</p><p>(Sec. 70401) This section increases the tax credit for employers that provide child care to their employees. Under this section, the portion of the tax credit for qualified child care expenses increases to 40% (from 25%) or to 50% for eligible small businesses. This section also increases the maximum amount of the tax credit to $500,000 (from $150,000) or $600,000 for eligible small businesses (adjusted for inflation).</p><p>(Sec. 70402) This section makes up to $5,000 of the adoption tax credit refundable and adjusts this amount annually for inflation after 2025. However, under this section, the refundable portion of the adoption tax credit may not be carried forward. (Under current law, the amount of the allowed adoption tax credit that exceeds an individual’s tax liability may be carried forward for up to five years.)</p><p>(Sec. 70403) This section allows Indian tribal governments to determine whether a child has special needs for purposes of calculating the adoption tax credit.</p><p>(Sec. 70404) This section increases to $7,500 (or $3,750 for a married individual filing separately) from $5,000 (or $2,500 for a married person filing separately) the exclusion from gross income for amounts paid or incurred by an employer to an employee as part of a dependent care assistance program.</p><p>(Sec. 70405) This section increases the non-refundable tax credit for expenses paid by an individual for the care of a child or dependent that enable such individual to be gainfully employed.&nbsp;</p><p>Subchapter B--Permanent Investments in Students and Reforms to Tax-Exempt Institutions</p><p>This subchapter makes multiple changes to federal tax provisions related to education and certain educational institutions.</p><p>Below is a summary of the provisions in this subchapter.</p><p>(Sec. 70411) This section establishes a nonrefundable tax credit of up to $1,700 for cash contributions made by an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States to a tax-exempt organization that provides scholarships for qualified elementary and secondary school expenses to eligible students (scholarship granting organization), subject to limitations.</p><p>(Sec. 70412) This section makes permanent the exclusion of education assistance paid by an employer to an employee (up to a maximum amount) from (1) gross income by an employee, and (2) wages by an employer (for employment tax purposes). Further, under this section, the maximum amount ($5,250 for 2025 and 2026) of employer-paid education assistance that may be excluded from gross income and wages is adjusted annually for inflation beginning in 2027.</p><p>(Sec. 70413) This section expands the expenses eligible for tax-free withdrawals from qualified tuition programs (529 plans) to include certain additional expenses related to enrollment or attendance at an&nbsp;elementary or secondary school.&nbsp;</p><p>This section also increases to $20,000 (from $10,000) the limit on distributions from a 529 plan used in connection with enrollment or attendance at an elementary or secondary school.</p><p>(Sec. 70414) This section expands the expenses eligible for tax-free withdrawals from 529 plans to include tuition, fees, books, supplies, equipment, and other expenses related to the enrollment or attendance in a recognized postsecondary credentialing program.</p><p>(Sec. 70415) This section replaces the excise tax of 1.4% imposed on the net investment income of certain private university and college endowments with a new rate structure of 1.4%, 4%, or 8%, depending on several variables including the value of the endowment and the number of full-time students who meet certain other requirements.</p><p>(Sec. 70416) This section expands the excise tax imposed on certain tax-exempt organizations for excess compensation paid to certain employees (an employee who is one of the top five highest compensated employees of such organization) to include excess compensation paid to any employee of such organization. (Thus, a tax-exempt organization is liable for an excise equal to the corporate tax rate [21%] multiplied by the sum of remuneration in excess of $1 million and excess parachute payment paid to any employee by the tax-exempt organization.)</p><p>Subchapter C--Permanent Investments in Community Development</p><p>This subchapter makes multiple changes to certain federal tax incentives related to investing in certain communities and tax deductions for charitable contributions.</p><p>Below is a summary of the provisions in this subchapter.</p><p>(Sec. 70421) This section permanently extends the Opportunity Zone program, establishes specific tax incentives for investments in rural areas, and modifies the rules related to deferred gains and stepped-up basis.</p><p>As background, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act temporarily authorized tax incentives for investments (made through qualified opportunity funds) in designated economically distressed areas (called qualified opportunity zones). Specifically, qualified opportunity fund investors may (1) defer capital gain if such gain is reinvested in a qualified opportunity fund within 180 days, (2) exclude from gross income all (or part) of the capital gains from qualified opportunity fund investments held for a certain period of time, and (3) receive a step up in basis (value of the capital asset when it is sold) of 10% for qualified opportunity fund investments held for at least five years and an additional 5% for qualified opportunity fund investments held for at least seven years. (An increase in the basis of a capital asset generally lowers the taxable amount of such asset.)</p><p>Under this section, capital gains from qualified opportunity fund investments made beginning in 2027, may be deferred to the earlier of the date on which such investment is sold or exchanged or five years after the date on which the investment is made. (Capital gain from qualified opportunity investments made before 2027, may be deferred to the earlier of the date on which such investment is sold or exchanged or December 31, 2026. (Thus, this section establishes a rolling five-year deferral for capital gains from qualified opportunity funds.)</p><p>This section also eliminates the additional 5% step up in basis for qualified opportunity zone fund investments held for at least 7 years, but increases the basis for such investments held for at least 10 years to the fair market value of the investment.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, this section establishes qualified rural opportunity funds for investments in rural areas. Investors in qualified rural opportunity funds may be eligible for a 30% step up in basis if certain requirements are met.</p><p>(Sec. 70422) This section increases eligibility for the low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) by increasing the amount that a state may allocate for the LIHTC and reducing the tax-exempt bond financing threshold.</p><p>As background, a taxpayer may claim the LIHTC for expenses incurred to rehabilitate or build rental housing for low-income tenants (1) if an allocation for the LIHTC is received from the state, or (2) a percentage of the project is financed by certain tax-exempt bonds. The amount a state may allocate for the LIHTC is calculated, in part, by multiplying a certain dollar amount (adjusted annually for inflation) by the state’s population.&nbsp;</p><p>Under this section, beginning in 2026, the portion of the federal allocation to each state for the LIHTC that is based on the state’s population is increased by 12%.</p><p>Further, this section lowers to 25% (from 50%) the tax-exempt bond threshold. Thus, under this section, if 25% or more of the aggregate basis (i.e., generally the costs) of the building and the land on which the building is located is financed with tax-exempt bonds, then the taxpayer is eligible for the LIHTC for the entire eligible basis of the project without a LIHTC allocation from the state. (If less than 25% of such basis is financed with tax-exempt bonds, then only the basis of the project that is financed with the tax-exempt bonds is eligible for the LIHTC.)</p><p>(Sec. 70423) This section permanently extends the New Markets Tax Credit (a tax credit for certain investments in eligible, low-income communities).</p><p>(Sec. 70424) This section makes permanent and increases to $1,000 for single filers (from $300) or $2,000 for joint filers (from $600 for joint filers) the tax deduction for charitable contributions made by individuals who do not itemize their federal income tax deductions.</p><p>(Sec. 70425) This section imposes a new limitation on the itemized tax deduction for charitable contributions made by individuals beginning in 2026. Under this section, an itemized tax deduction for charitable contributions is allowed only to the extent that an individual’s aggregate charitable contributions exceed 0.5% of the individual’s contribution base (adjusted gross income calculated without including any net operating loss carryback amount). (This limitation is generally known as the 0.5% floor for the itemized tax deduction for individual charitable contributions and does not apply to tax deductions for charitable contributions made by individuals who do not itemize their tax deductions under Section 70424 of this act.)</p><p>Further, under this section, the 0.5% floor also applies to excess charitable contributions made by individuals in 2026 or after that are carried forward to subsequent tax years. (Excess charitable contributions made prior to 2026 that are carried forward to subsequent tax year are not subject to the 0.5% floor.)&nbsp;</p><p>(Sec. 70426) This section further limits the tax deduction for charitable contributions made by a corporation beginning in 2026. Under this section, a tax deduction for charitable contributions made by a corporation is allowed only to the extent that the corporation’s aggregate charitable contributions exceed 1% of the corporation’s taxable income. (This limitation is generally known as the 1% floor for the tax deduction for charitable contributions made by a corporation.)&nbsp;</p><p>As a result of the 1% floor imposed by this section and existing limitations, a corporation may deduct charitable contributions only to the extent that such contributions exceed 1% of the corporation’s taxable income but do not exceed 10% of the corporation’s taxable income (10% limit).</p><p>Finally, under this section, special rules and limitations also apply to corporate charitable contributions carried forward to subsequent tax years.</p><p>(Sec. 70427) This section reinstates and makes permanent (beginning in 2026) the $13.25 (currently $10.50) per proof gallon limit on the&nbsp;amount that is transferred by the United States to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands for excise taxes collected on distilled spirits (e.g., rum) imported from Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p><p>As background, the United States imposes an excise tax of $13.50 per proof gallon on distilled spirits produced in or imported into the United States. A certain amount of the excise tax collected on distilled spirits imported from Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are transferred back into the treasury of each possession. (This transfer is commonly known as the cover over or the rum cover over.) For 2022-2026, the rum cover over amount is limited to $10.50 per proof gallon. An additional rum cover over in the amount of $2.75 (for a total rum cover over of $13.25) authorized by Congress expired at the end of 2021.</p><p>(Sec. 70428) This section treats participation or investment in fisheries (e.g., harvesting, processing, transportation, sales, and marketing of fish and fish products) in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands by certain tax-exempt Alaskan villages as substantially related to the village’s tax-exempt purpose and, thus, income gained from such activities remains tax-exempt.</p><p>(Sec. 70429) This section increases to $50,000 (from $10,000) the limit on the tax deduction for &nbsp;expenses incurred by a whaling captain (as recognized by the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission) in carrying out sanctioned bowhead whaling activities.</p><p>(Sec. 70430) This section allows certain residential construction contracts entered into in tax years beginning after July 4, 2025, to use another permissible method of accounting (e.g., the uniform capitalization rules), rather than the percentage&nbsp;of&nbsp;completion method of accounting. (The percentage of completion method of accounting or the percentage of completion-capitalized cost accounting method of accounting is used for residential construction contracts that are not home construction contracts and that are entered into in tax years beginning on or before July 4, 2025.)</p><p>Subchapter D--Permanent Investments in Small Business and Rural America</p><p>This subchapter modifies certain reporting requirements related to third-party settlement organizations and makes changes to several other federal tax provisions.</p><p>Below is a summary of the key provisions in this subchapter.</p><p>(Sec. 70432) This section modifies the reporting requirements applicable to third-party settlement organizations (e.g., certain online platforms, apps, and card payment processors). Under this section, such organizations are required to issue Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 1099-K to payees who receive more than $20,000 from more than 200 separate transactions. (This section reverses a provision in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 that lowered the reporting threshold to $600 with no minimum on the number of transactions, the implementation of which was delayed and phased in by the IRS. For 2025, under current law, such organizations are required to issue IRS Form 1099-K to payees who receive more than $2,500, regardless of the number of transactions.)</p><p>(Sec. 70434) This section expands the federal tax deduction for certain film, television, and theatrical production costs to allow a deduction of up to $150,000 of qualified sound recording production costs in the tax year such costs are incurred. A qualified sound recording production is a sound recording that is produced and recorded in the United States. (Under current law, up to $20 million of film, television, and theatrical production costs incurred before 2026 may be deducted.)</p><p>The section also extends bonus depreciation to qualified sound recording production costs.</p><p>(Sec. 70436) This section eliminates the $200 excise tax imposed on the transfer of certain firearms other than machine guns and destructive devices&nbsp;(e.g., bombs, grenades, certain rockets, missiles, and mines). As a result, the $200 excise tax is not applicable to silencers, short-barreled rifles and short-barreled shotguns.</p><p>Chapter 5--Ending Green New Deal Spending, Promoting America-First Energy and Other Reforms</p><p>Subchapter A--Termination of Green New Deal Subsidies</p><p>This subchapter terminates multiple energy-related federal tax credits.</p><p>Below is a summary of the provisions in this subchapter.</p><p>(Sec. 70501) This section terminates the previously-owned clean vehicle tax credit. (Thus, taxpayers may claim a tax credit of up to $4,000 for the purchase of a qualified previously-owned clean vehicle before October 1, 2025.)</p><p>(Sec. 70502) This section terminates the clean vehicle tax credit. (Thus, taxpayers may claim a tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of a qualified new clean vehicle before October 1, 2025.)</p><p>(Sec. 70503) This section terminates the qualified commercial clean vehicle tax credit. (Thus, businesses may claim a tax credit of up to $40,000 for the purchase of a commercial clean vehicle before October 1, 2025.)</p><p>(Sec. 70504) This section terminates the alternative fuel refueling property tax credit. (Thus, a tax credit of up to $1,000 for individuals or up to $100,000 for businesses is allowed for the installation of property before July 1, 2026, that is used to store or dispense clean-burning fuel or to recharge electric vehicles.)</p><p>(Sec. 70505) This section terminates the energy efficient home improvement tax credit. (Thus, taxpayers may claim a tax credit of up to $3,200, for certain energy-efficient property purchased and installed into a primary residence before&nbsp;2026.)</p><p>(Sec. 70506) This section terminates the residential clean energy tax credit. (Thus, taxpayers may claim a tax credit for certain renewable energy equipment for a principal residence before&nbsp;2026.)</p><p>(Sec. 70507) This section terminates the energy efficient commercial buildings tax deduction. (Thus, taxpayers may claim a deduction for certain energy efficient commercial property the construction of which begins before July 1, 2027.)</p><p>(Sec. 70508) This section terminates the new energy efficient home tax credit. (Thus, contractors may claim a business tax credit for constructing an energy-efficient home that is acquired by a person for use as a residence before July 1, 2026.)</p><p>(Sec. 70509) This section terminates the special five-year cost recovery period for investments in certain solar and wind property for which construction begins after December 31, 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>As background, costs of property used in a trade or business to produce income generally are capitalized and then depreciated or amortized over a period of time (known as the cost recovery period). The cost recovery period for property used to produce electricity generally depends on the method for producing such electricity. However, for certain solar and wind property for which construction begins on or before December 31, 2024, the cost recovery period is five years. For solar and wind property for which construction begins after December 31, 2024, the general modified accelerated cost recovery system (MACRS) and Internal Revenue Service guidance apply.</p><p>(Sec. 70510) This section disallows the zero-emission nuclear power production tax credit for certain foreign entities and foreign-influenced entities (e.g., taxpayers that make certain types of payments to certain foreign entities). (The zero-emission nuclear power production tax credit generally is allowed for electricity produced at a qualified nuclear power facility and sold to an unrelated third person.)</p><p>(Sec. 70511) This section terminates the clean hydrogen production tax credit in 2028 and, thus, the tax credit is allowed only for clean hydrogen production facilities for which construction begins before January 1, 2028. (As background, prior to changes made by this section, the tax credit is available for the production of clean hydrogen by a qualifying facility for which construction begins before 2033.)</p><p>(Sec. 70512) This section terminates the clean electricity production tax credit for (1) wind and solar facilities placed into service after December 31, 2027, and (2) certain wind energy property or solar water heating property if such property is leased to a third party during the tax year. (As background, a tax credit is allowed, other than as provided by this section and subject to limitations, for clean electricity produced by a qualified facility. The tax credit is phased out beginning in the later of 2032 or when greenhouse gas emissions from the production of electricity are reduced to a certain level.) &nbsp;</p><p>This section also disallows the clean electricity production tax credit for certain foreign entities and foreign-influenced entities (e.g., taxpayers that make certain types of payments to certain foreign entities).&nbsp;</p><p>Further, under this section, penalties may be imposed for (1) substantial misstatements of a certain amount related to the supply chain of manufactured products and product components for which the clean electricity production tax credit is claimed, and (2) overstating depreciable assets to claim the clean energy production tax credit. (Under this act, such penalties are also applicable to the clean electricity investment tax credit and the advanced manufacturing production tax credit.)</p><p>(Sec. 70513) This section terminates the clean electricity investment credit for (1) wind and solar property, other than energy storage technology, placed into service after December 31, 2027; and (2) certain wind energy property, solar electric property, and solar water heating property if such property is leased to a third party during the tax year.

States must submit detailed rural health transformation plans and certify that no funds will be used to finance the non-federal share of Medicaid or CHIP. The CMS must approve or deny applications by December 31, 2025; states that receive approval do not need to reapply each year. States are not required to contribute any matching funds with respect to program allotments.</p><p>The CMS must award allotments so that 50% of funds are awarded equally among all approved states. The remaining 50% of funds must be awarded based on certain considerations, including the proportion of rural health facilities in the state compared to the number of such facilities nationwide.</p><p>The section additionally provides $200 million for FY2025 for the CMS to implement the program.&nbsp;</p><p>Subtitle C--Increase in Debt Limit</p><p>(Sec. 72001) This section increases the statutory debt limit by $5 trillion.

Beginning with the 2024-2025 academic year, the net worth of these farms and businesses are treated as an asset and therefore included in the calculation. This section (1) restores the exemption to exclude the net worth of these family farms and family-owned small businesses from the calculation, and (2) expands the exemption to exclude the net worth of family-owned commercial fisheries from the calculation.</p><p>Subtitle B--Loan Limits</p><p>This subtitle makes various changes to federal student loans.&nbsp;</p><p>(Sec. 81001)&nbsp;This section revises the types of federal student loans available to borrowers under the Direct Loan program and the borrowing limits for these loans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The section terminates the ability of graduate or professional students to receive Direct PLUS Loans (i.e., Grad PLUS Loans) beginning on July 1, 2026.</p><p>The section revises the annual and aggregate limits an individual may borrow in Direct Loans.
